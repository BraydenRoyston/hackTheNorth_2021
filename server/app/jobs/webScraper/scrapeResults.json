Keep buying meme stocks if that\u2019s your thingDude...read the fuckin' roomAnyone quoting GME's business as the primary reason behind the move is an idiot. They've done alright given their situation, but the short squeeze from institutions betting poorly is what's driving it up right now.Wait till this guy hears about omnichannel, streaming, electronic downloads, etcCalling them a video game retailer is so ignorant, first of all, like Tesla, when you have a once in a generation type genius in charge you are investing as much in the person as the company and their products, and secondly Ryan Cohen is going to completely rebuild the business for the digital age, 35-40 is the new floorFrom an options standpoint your break even is around $17. The IV is 170% and delta is only .1. There is support around the 17-18 range. Your best bet is GME crashes in Feb and March, and even then you can lose value in IV for not a lot of delta. \n\nWhy jump in front of the moving train this early?The hive mind is the strength of the sub though?  It is a dumb thing when people pile on insults or something but when everyone is ponying up ducats it honest to god affects the market.

But AFTER earnings\u2026..", "selfText": "Obviously, $GME Q4 results are a day of reckoning for this business. I have long been tracking this company but I only recently got in with some skin in the game (disclosure \u2013 I own \\~3000 shares; I am also new to WSB:)). I also think Q3 is an important moment for the company given the institutional dynamics, but **I do NOT think holding through 12/8 would be a good gamble** (which is why you are seeing several people sell their shares to buy in later). Instead, I think there is a better way to play earnings on 12/8.\n\nFirst off, as everyone knows, Q3 results are going to be ugly. Some have made the argument that the market has already priced this in, but this is only partially true. **Market pricing is dictated by both event-driven probability and hype.** I would guess that the probability of GME missing consensus estimates is \\~50/50 (note missing consensus estimates is different from negative growth which is guaranteed in this case). Nobody knows where things will shake out, so the market will price it as such. However, there is a tremendous amount of hype around this stock (for good reason in my humble opinion), which is why I think this stock is trading well heading into an earnings announcement for a turbulent quarter.\n\nNow, **one way to estimate performance is by using credit card activity as a proxy for performance**. We can then use this and compare it to consensus estimates by research analysts:\n\n*Same-Store Sales*\n\n* Telsey: -27.0% (as of 12/2/20)\n* Wedbush: -20.0% (as of 12/4/20)\n\n**If you look at credit card data scrapping services, it looks like the quarter will end down around 25 \u2013 30%** (based on the service you use). Obviously this is close to the Telsey number, but its worth noting that these credit card services slightly overestimated performance in Q2 (so the number will likely be closer to -30%). **Therefore, I have a feeling that this stock is going to sell-off significantly**, **making it a much better entry point versus pre-earnings.**\n\n**Personally, I am still long this stock, but it seems like the stock is going to drop in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, which is why I will be holding off from buying on Monday. I\u2019m definitely going to scoop up some more after earnings however!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy to answer any questions :)", "score": 29, "comment": "This guy is trying to get GME gang to sell shares. \n\nWho you working for?If you have the belief that the ultimate direction is up, it may be dangerous to sell and try to get in later. It might cause the loss of potential profits if you sell and have to average up on unexpected good news. \n\nIf you believe that we will go up, then you'll ultimately get there if it plays out that way whether or not you pull out and get back in.I think weak earnings are priced in despite the run up in share price. Shorts have continued to double down and I think anyone still in it is there for the squeeze. \n\nWhat will likely prevent a broad sell off will be positive guidance which is expected and probably not entirely priced in. I think after Cohen\u2019s letter, management is already shitting bricks so expect a very rosy forecast. I\u2019m sure the CEO is already trying to save his job so the way I see it he\u2019s not about to fuck this up.\n\nPositions: 2900 sharesWe're trying to kick start a short squeeze and you're telling us to sell. Fuck off Melvin Capital! I'm buying GME all month until I'm on the fucking moon \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I think that Q3 results will be less important than future outlook, because as you said, everyone knows they suffered huge losses. Been in since 12 though, so it doesn't matter much to me. On the slim chance that there is a major shift in company structure or otherwise, getting in before earnings gets you exposure to any of that. There seems to be more upside than downside to me since they are expected to perform poorly, and any deviation from that, or planning for future events, can cause the stock to rise.You are missing something in your analysis that I need.\n\nYou are telling me that puts would be wise. Okay. That is fine. What you're not telling me is whether IV will fall. If the IV doesn't fall then you are better off simply buying puts and converting them into calls after earnings if you believe that the stock will fall.\n\nHowever I have a feeling that IV will *rise* after earnings substantially making it far worse to get in no matter the value of the entry point. Basically over time you'll be paying, for the same option, twice as much as you would have if you had held through earnings.\n\nThat is my only challenge to your analysis; if you're looking at shares, fine, you're right, but most people are looking for options here.Got $20 calls for april that are up about 100% and shares. Was just going to hold through earnings but now I'm considering selling the calls and holding the shares through. What do you guys think, maybe do that and buy the calls back after or just hold everything? I just feel like theres a chance they could have good guidance or maybe Cohen makes a move with earnings so I don't want to miss anything.I sold dec11 $20 covered calls for like $120/contract and used that money to buy 14/17c spreads for 12/18. Near zero risk imonah. I'm bullish on Q3 because the b&m retail sector in general was able to achieve positive EPS. There's the CARES act to count on too to boost EPS2 words- Ryan CohenNo, the market is forward looking. Even if earnings are rough, they are going to announce how many stocks they bought or a new initiative and the stock will boom!\n\nThey have to nail this or RC is going to dismantle the bird.Going into earnings with shares and iron condors. Ready for anything (including bagholding).I sold 6 $15puts expiring next week. Would love for a dip to get assignedNice analysis. Personally I think it will ride into earnings and sell of either at them or slightly before. Going to pick up a short term 1 day trade, dump and then pick up again after the inevitable fall for the long termIf earnings are bad, won't that just push the short squeeze that much harder?And bad earnings is priced in, no one gives af about sales unless they do better than expected. This is all about guidance and Dogman taking over or not. This ain't your normal earnings retard.I\u2019m agreeing with you on this. I think the dip will get bought up pretty quick before it is too significant though.\n\nI\u2019m too afraid something unexpected will come up and push it up so I\u2019m holding longer calls and selling short term for the premium.[deleted]If one feels this way, sell covered calls and *do not* sell shares.  This is not something you want to time the market on.  You will be wrong and it will be to your detriment.Why not just buy some puts on Monday to protect downside and if it doesn't tank sell the puts on Wednesday?If q3 will be bad Cohen will swing his dick so hard even CEO will ask him to step in and end his sad life. If earnings will be good, stock will rocket harder than NIO when it was actually good meme stockNo way I get out of my position to avoid a bad reaction to earnings. That's how you miss the squeeze. If anything it would just be a good incentive to buy more. Maybe hedge with some cheap weekly puts.I\u2019ll be trimming some of my calls right before earnings to lock in gains but selling shares is not the move at allGme is a garbage company and a dumpster fire.... \n\nThe short interest and possibly of a short squeeze is appealing as well. \n\nBut I will not  buy it until the squeeze starts happening. If it gets over 20 I will start buying and use buy at market orders to help the squeeze. \n\nAfter earnings if it gets over 20 I'm in. But I dont think the numbers are going to be good with pandemic etc.... \n\nIt's a wait and see game...I think you make a reasonable, data driven point about the same store sales. \n\nIf we left out all the incremental initiatives/items (rollout of nascent digital advertising, clarification of the MSFT partnership impact [Melvin is known to have called it a \u201cnothing burger\u201d and don\u2019t buy the lifetime rev share value as being material], any quantification of the blowout November performance & affirmation of market share leading allocations, etc.) then I\u2019d agree.  \n\nNo one fucking knows what\u2019s going to happen, it very well may dip, especially if (when?) the big shorts decide to get aggro and try controlling a negative narrative. \n\nI suspect that any post ER dip gets bought hard.\n\nPositions: 9000 shares, more than 100 $10C from Apr21 to Jan22, and nearly that many deep OTM LEAPSI keep saying this; I don't know why people suddenly think because they are planning to transition to an online store, they're going to go up from earnings. I am not even sure GME is the largest sale of this console generation either. All my local EB games got 4-5 consoles. Walmart, bestbuy and other places here were SELLING the console online release day still lol. EB games online wasn't selling any consoles 6 hours after it was on the website for preorders.\n\nPlus, people seem to forget earnings almost always causes a dip. Even when they post slightly above expectations.1. Timing the market is typically not a good call. \n \n2. Totally not suspicious that a several year old account with one other post (about a sitcom) is telling us all not to buy in.i agree with your assessment about q3 reports....but this has to be all about q4 and the future. what they plan on doing with the increase of holiday lockdowns and how they plan on capitalizing.I'm surprised you didn't mention the squeezeThis CC gonna be more hyped than SBAgreed.

Too retarded to fully understand options so I\u2019m looking at shares. I have a RH deposit clearing on the 7th, are you suggesting to wait until after earnings report to buy?Shitty earnings are expected and priced in. If they  perform only slightly shitty they may get a pump.What about buying some puts to hedge shares into earnings. Then of it drops you can buy more and avg down and if it goes up u take a small loss and still in the big shares playYou son of a bitch I\u2019m inIf you own shares in this thing. I think the risk of potentially missing a news headline or an earnings surprise is too great. I got burned trying to do what you recommend. I had north of 3k shares and sold 400, 2 hours later Microsoft signed a revenue sharing agreement and GameStop was halted for trading. Then it shot up 50%. I\u2019m holding through at least the March earnings report. Keep in mind also, they are buying 63% of their short term debt early, 3 days after earnings...things can\u2019t be that bad if their cash flow is being used this way.2019Q1,2019Q2, 2019Q3, 2020Q2 CC data under reported sales.... Also have we baked in currency tailwinds from the dollar's vast underperfomance? I think we will be around 1bil in rev but positive EPS. There is your surprise.Ok so what\u2019s to like about this stock. As an outsider looking in, it just looks like an outdated business model with a management team that isn\u2019t making any changes. Please help me understand the hypeTo be frank eb games / GameStop has always been the last place on my mind as a gamer .. hate the store ... hate the people working there . There sales suck .. trade in values suck \n\nPeople buy games digitally right off the damn store on Xbox and PlayStation of steam bypassing these goofs altogether \n\nSelling a game console is at cost for them ... brand new games are profits or cents or a dollar I believe ...\n\nWhy is this place going up ?Illuminati confirmed if they beat their fucking ER when did PS5 start selling?Oh Look, we got a Alpha paperhand over hear. Go dumb ur shares with ur weak ass paperhands. Stupid boiWe see you SUS from Melvin Capital!yea for goodness sake, don\u2019t try to time the market.\n\nno one knows how it will go after earnings. Expectations are already shitty. No one expects anything good from Q3. Even if it does drop, it will recover quickly simply because of the many bull factors.\n\nEarnings is just a small factor. Guidance, new strategic initiatives, developments are equally or even more important.\n\nEdit: If you are really scared, sell covered calls because if price rockets, at least you secure some gains. If it does drop, at least you have some hedge. If you sell your shares, it\u2019s just... unwise. If you are willing to sacrifice a huge potential gain for a tiny loss then you might as well invest in ETFs...\n\nLike OP said, GME is going up in the long run. With a short squeeze, does it matter whether you entered at 14,15,16,17 or even 20s?Haha! Just sharing my personal thoughts/analysis :)Thanks for your thoughts. I agree, long term this is going up. My commentary was just trying to shed some light on my short term perspective.I don't think maybe people have actually [read the letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC%20Ventures%20Letter%20to%20GameStop.pdf). This is some HEAT they have to respond to, and it better be good.Interesting perspective - congrats to you for being smart enough to get in on this last year! I agree that for the longer term, Q3 is meaningless, but I do think the market will react to any miss vs. the latest consensus numbers.i though iv falls after earnings report. can you expand on why you think iv will rise instead? thanks man.Thanks for the perspective u/Everyman_B. You raise a good point - I can't comment on option strategy here as that is not my forte. This analysis was targeted at current/future share holders.I wouldn't sell either. April calls won't be affected as much by IV or negative news.  I have a feeling after Earnings IV may increase and those same call may be the same price at a lower share price because of that.A split/hedged risk sounds reasonable.\n\nYou never know what else they might still announce, apart from the un-interesting Q3 results.Nice. Yeah, I\u2019m too in the business of collecting premium, last position - sold $21 12/11 calls for about $110 and bought some cheap-ass puts to hedge against earnings.Thanks for the perspective. To be fair, a lot of the B&M players were able to generate positive comps through COVID which will not be the case here. That being said, the CARES act could be an interesting dynamic.He is certainly a catalyst for this stock!They will have bought zero shares. Stop spreading this misinformation. Management clearly said they aren\u2019t buying back sharesYeah. Either way, it can go only upwards.\n\nActually, the chances of screwing up seem rather low.>, the market is forward looking. Even if earnings are rough, they are going to announce how many stocks they bought or a new initiative and the stock will boom!\n\nI agree with you that the market is forward looking. However, that assumes that they have forward-looking data which we may or may not have (i.e. depends on whether management discloses this information).Best of luck. Definitely important to have big cajones for this play!Interesting strategy. Thanks for sharingAppreciate it! Short term risk hedging could be a good way to play this as well. Best of luck.I don\u2019t think that bad earnings (on its own) would be the catalyst. Perhaps, this would prompt RC Ventures and Cohen to react, but this is a different issue.>selling short term for the premium.\n\nCool - best of luck!Yep - credit card data includes both online and in-store sales. Obviously, the data is imperfect, but it is good proxy given lack of data.I agree selling CCs is wiser than selling shares. However, if you're selling CCs when the squeeze could happen at any time, aren't you essentially trying to time the market that the squeeze won't happen during your CC selling? You'll miss out on gains if the squeeze happens and you have to sell your shares for way cheaperSmart. 20 seems like a good entry and might indicate the beginning of the squeeze. See you there fam!I whole heartedly agree that Q3 numbers are insignificant longer term (which is why I am still long). However, at the end of the day, Wall Street is Wall Street and they care about earnings beats/misses.I think the squeeze has been mentioned enough for one day! That is definitely a plus but it could be weeks / months / years. I definitely can't predict that one haha!Haha glad this was helpful! Per the above, consider getting in AFTER earnings on 12/8. You might be able to get a more attractive price :)Thanks for the comment. I would point you to several of the posts already made on this subreddit in the last week or so (can just google $GME). They have done a great job outlining the bull case here. That being said, you would need to have a much higher risk threshold here to make money given the large swings, so it's definitely not for everyone :)Short squeezeIt is an outdated business model as is. Hype will come from them actively making moves to conform to the current digital age and making improvements. There are a number of catalysts that can basically set off a rapid market buy, thus the hypothetical squeeze people are talking about. They paid off a significant amount of debt recently. There's also the new console cycle with the PS and Xbox. I don't know what GME will be in five years, but I do believe that this is a solid money maker in the very near term.>I play video games a lot and made stupid trade ins as a kid so now I know the fair value of this company\n\nIt's going up because the share price didn't / doesn't maybe reflect the value of the company.Guidance will be good.Sold $18 covered call for this week and sold $20 for next week. Its a good bonus for sharesWhen did the market ever move based on the quarterly report? Its all about the guidance bro. Go back to your mamaYou brought up some excellent points, though if someone were intent on selling out and getting back in I might recommend selling covered calls that net a ton due to the high IV. To hedge against missing out on a possible spike right after earnings, you could buy calls a few strikes above the ones you sold.Sharing your short term view while still holding the shares. GTFO dude, stop being a pussy and walk the talk.IV doesn't always fall after events. It's less an explanation and more of an observation; IV movement can actually increase or decrease at any time, most stocks aren't interesting plays of course which is why the IV falls so hard but for those that are IV can sustain or even grow. GME earnings is *not* the event sought so IV may not react at all.Earnings won't predict short squeeze so the IV might not get cut in half immediately after earnings. Typically earnings + guidance kills uncertainty/IV but does not make up for other black swans like a unpredictable short squeeze. Even if RC doesn't try a takeover or GME doesn't offer a buyback the squeeze might still happen. \n\nRKT had the same level of IV but immediately dropped 80-100% after earnings, you could have sold 2021 $40 calls for $10/contract and bought them back for $1-2/contract two weeks later (even at a sh price of 25-28), I sold shorter dated puts and calls and made decent return, enough to still sell my RKT shs at $21 for a profit. I'm a bit more cautious selling cc's for my GME shs this time but if they get called away I'll take my 30% gains and move on.Got it. Well, then it is a fine analysis for what it is.Rip to your puts, if they were cheap they were otm and iv crush will kill them!And he filed an intent to purchase with the SEC if management doesn\u2019t make the changes he suggested. Its going to be an interesting few weeks.Who knows what they will announce. Buybacks are one possibility, a major game changer is another. Either way, they have to nail it or the great white shark known as RC will eat them for lunch! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude0ePorshe wasn't buying Volkswagen. Until they did.Like selling covered calls? I was thinking about doing that with GME before earnings..[deleted]I\u2019m selling 3 covered calls for $22 Dec 11. Someone is paying me $300 in premiums for this.to a degree.  my #1 concern regarding this call....is hearing them say they can\u2019t forecast q4 because of supply constraints from sony and microsoft and nintendo for consoles. from what i tracked this year....every company that did this got spanked.Or you may be buying in at a higher price.  I have been buying every time it dips under $16.  Bought 100 shares today under $17.  MM were holding price down today so $17 calls expired worthless.  I think it would have been at $18 otherwise.\n\nI think GME may be like Nordstrom and pump because the news wasn't as bad as they expect plus debt payoff, plus any 2021/future plans.  They also still have $100M in stock buybacks that was already approved last year that they didn't use.What\u2019s the move long calls short calls or putsThank you. I\u2019ve been trying to look past these posts all week since it isn\u2019t PLTR but I\u2019ll have to do some DD this weekendThank you for the reply, what is the time frame that these catalyst are set to take place? It sounds like everybody is expecting earnings to be shit with good guidance into the future.\nDebt buy back is big, but have they announced anything as to what the plan is to digitalize?The company was closing stores left right and centre and pay stupid rent in dieing malls \n\nYou idiots realize that brand new ps5 is sold at cost for 499 ... these clowns don\u2019t make moneyIs guidance guaranteed? Other b&m retailers are not providing guidance in latest ER. Not sure why it would benefit mgmt to release now, during all this uncertainty.100% priced in.\n\nEdit: what isn\u2019t priced in is the Cohen taking over and their partnership with Sony digital sales on ps4 just wait for that catalystfuck thats good advice. just sold my first cc ever today on GME 20c 12/11. Never thought about buying a call incase it fuckin moons suddenlyInteresting strategy - thank you for sharing.I understand your sentiment but I think he\u2019s genuinely trying to help people find a better entrance price and he raises valid, very real pointsThe ER and following investor call is exactly why IV has spiked. It would take a big announcement to make the IV go even higher afterwards. We're already at 225%+I appreciate that :)Don\u2019t spread misinformationThis might be the dumbest post I have read. This is about a Company buying back their own shares - which they announce ahead of time.\n\nAnother gambler that doesn\u2019t even know the basics of what they are buyingPerhaps, but I am sure there are experts here who know more about hedging. For my part, I will be holding off on buying before earnings completely.better to sell puts in case it spikes on good guidance. calls could lose your sharesAbsolutely. I\u2019ll dig that up and share. It\u2019s worth noting that most of these services are paid services, but I can share screenshots to the extent that is helpful :)Right. And if (not likely, but IF) $GME rockets up to $30 before Dec. 11, then you just missed out on like $2,400 (300 shares x $8/per share appreciation).I also bought 101 shares for $16.81 each today. I can double the number of shares if the price drops a bit after earnings, but it's a guess at this point.I'd expect sometime between Q3 to Q4 earnings. Three month period, maybe. If Cohen doesn't like earnings, he has publicly implied* that he'll initiate a takeover, so that could be a catalyst. I'm sure anything they announce will be on Dec 8th. Anything can happen, so it's just sitting and waitingIf they don\u2019t provide guidance, shareholders will eat them alive. Especially after the whole Cohen ordeal.Yeah... you'll have to hope we don't gap up on Monday if you're wanting a call to protect your upside, or hope that we don't moon in general until you're out from under the $20c. Don't fomo, that's how people lose money. Theta gang is always a good play, though on a stock with moon potential like this you may want to modify your plays. \n\nSomething I did on RIOT was own ITM calls and sell call credit spreads, essentially making them covered call credit spreads. You're losing some premium compared to just the covered call, but you miss a minimal amount if we moon.No problem, feel free to ask questions.IV for GME has been this high for months. No one could possibly care about the earnings. To even say that is to not understand the GME situation. The short-squeeze definitely is not something regarding the earnings of GME.It's screaming... short me!Sorry I heard that on hereBut isn't the point to protect my position if it doesn't spike. How does selling puts do that?Yes. That\u2019s is the risk.  But your implying the stock might double in a week.Thank you, I\u2019ll do some DD this weekend!He never said anything of the sort. It is only implied in his letter.The investor call is where we expect the board to have to respond to RC since he sent it during the quiet period.No, that's just you after every GME commentI'm genuinely curious not being argumentative. I just started messing with covered calls and I dont think I grasp covered puts as clearly yet.. Reading up on it.It doesn't protect your existent position at all, I think he's trying to present it as an alternative to a buy-write.Still won't matter. Console cycle is where the money is. Cohen is ... well if Cohen didn't exist console cycle is where the money is anyway. Cohen is a weird variable.Short me!Selling a put when IV is high means you will collect the premium and possibly pick up more shares at a lower price. The premium you get when you sell it is your protection. And if it doesn't drop, you keep it anyway.Gotcha thanks for clearing that up. If I can ask one more question. So when you write a covered call you want it to match your shares. So 500 shares would mean 5 covered calls. Is it the same with selling puts or is the short position I'm opening independent of those shares?No, puts are secured with cash so if you sell a 15p you'd have $1500 used as collateral until the position is closed or you get assigned.Ah ok.

Y'all remember Marie Kondo? Japanese woman that gets off to cleaning people's shit up for them? Only keep things that spark joy? Fuck yeah. Well, with all you retards losing money by being balls long PLTR, I figured it was time to help you Marie Kondo your own portfolio. Let's tidy that shit up and spark some fucking Joyy.\n\nYes I spelled Joyy with two y's. And no big brain, that wasn't a typo. **Joyy ($YY) is your next one-way ticket to the goddamn moon.** Can you do basic math? Great. Neither can I. Do you get slightly aroused at the mere sight of a woman with a pulse? Of course you do. I myself just went six to midnight typing that out. Do you like losing money in the stonk market? Clearly. But I'm here to try to change that.\n\nCongrats on making it this far. Let's get started!\n\n$YY is the largest live-streaming platform you've never heard of. **It's like if TikTok merged with OnlyFans and was a publicly traded stonk**. I'll wait while you buy a few shares on that premise alone.\n\nBut it gets better. Much better. Joyy operates two live-streaming services, one is called YY Live and its getting sold to Baidu for $3.6bn. **The other is called Bigo Live and it's one of the top 10 apps in the world with revenues growing more than 130% y/y.** Many of the videos on Bigo are of hot Asian women live-streaming themselves dancing. Nice.\n\nThat's still not even the best part though. Galaxy brain question: would you rather pay full price for something or get something at a discount? What if you could get it for close to free? Well, at YY's current price, you're nearly getting Bigo Live for free. Please consult a doctor if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours.\n\nHow can that be? This part requires some remedial math skills that you and I both don't have, but alas, we must soldier on.\n\nYY currently has $2.8bn in net cash on their balance sheet. Woah! I didn't know this was a fucking advanced accounting class. Well it is. Stay with me. We also know YY is going to get $3.6bn in cash from Baidu for the sale of YY Live. Lastly, YY is an investor in a company called HUYA that is valued at $750mm.\n\nSo... $2.8bn plus $3.6bn plus $750mm is? No, not $420.69 you retard. Try again. It's $7.1bn. Feel free to sit down and drink a sip of water if your head is spinning from all these numbers.\n\nCompare this $7.1bn to YY's current market cap of $7.8bn. $7.8bn minus $7.1bn for everything that isn't Bigo Live is $600mm. There you have it. That's the implied value the market is giving to Bigo Live.\n\nHoly shit right? To quote the great David Byrne from Talking Heads: [you may ask yourself](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=69)...\n\n* Didn't Baidu just pay $3.6bn for YY Live?\n* And isn't Bigo Live growing 130%+ while YY Live is barely growing?\n* And aren't Bigo Live and YY Live about the same size at $1.8bn in revenues?\n* And finally \u2013 you may ask yourself \u2013 if Baidu is willing to pay $3.6bn for YY Live, shouldn't Bigo Live be valued way the fuck more than that?\n\n**The answer to all of these questions is fuck yes.** Bigo Live should be valued way higher than $600mm but you retards are too busy jacking off and losing money on PLTR to figure it out.\n\n**The other great part about YY is we get to fuck some bears on our way to the moon**. I cannot expressly condone nor condemn the actual fucking of bears, but I can condone the fucking of some short sellers. Muddy Waters just released a short report on Joyy and short sellers piled in like the dumbass lemmings they are. How did YY respond to the short report you may ask? **By giving MW the double middle finger and increasing their dividend by $200mm.** Do frauds usually do that? Hell no they don't.\n\nThat's how you fucking spark Joyy in your portfolio!", "score": 2, "comment": "Isn't this the company generating fake #s with bots?

Plus, why just take a picture of your dong after jerk off onto a hundo when you could livestream the whole thing?YY is headquartered in Singapore and their only direct exposure to China is through YY Live. After the sale to Baidu closes, they'll no longer have any direct exposure to Chinese regulations or risk from the potential delisting of Chinese stocks.Those lawsuits don't mean anything.

The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK\u2019s intrinsic value.\n\nMARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK\u2019s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.\n\nThe resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.\n\nThe Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company\u2019s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK\u2019s auditor has not resigned and the Company\u2019s past audits have been qualified with \u201cgoing concern\u201d risk language, so at this point the auditor\u2019s opinion letter can\u2019t get much worse\u2026.unless they refuse to provide an opinion\u2026which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.\n\nAs we get closer to MARK\u2019s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28\u2026.market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company\u2019s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company\u2019s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization\u2019s credibility.\n\nMARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company\u2019s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company\u2019s rare and effective official statement of April 30.\n\nIt is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK\u2019s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK\u2019s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK\u2019s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).\n\nThe value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG\u2019s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK\u2019s current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention.", "score": 0, "comment": "Penny stocks are very dangerous do not listen to this bullshitThis stock is being shilled on stocktwits very hard.

Its a form of security theatre. Business want them so they can make people feel safe but if government agencies aren't going to mandate them the demand of the thermal imaging technology is not going to substantially increase. Thermal Imaging does little to prevent COVID due to 80% of all people being asymptomatic of those who get infected.Still didn\u2019t age well hahayou sure about that lol?You\u2019re questioning if this will prevent the virus, a vaccine of some sort. That\u2019s not the purpose of thermal imaging or this company. A high percentage of Covid cases have fever like symptoms. I did not say all, but a high percentage. These thermal imaging devices can detect the body temperature within .3 percent. Facts matter, so I\u2019ll have to edit this comment with the links I read yesterday. So if big stores can preach safety to the public by being able to detect high body temperature before entering their stores, I\u2019m assuming that is a step towards preventing spread. That alone is something the general mass would love to hear and seems worthwhile.I think it aged perfectly actually considering the stock is down 30% in the past 2 trading days.bruh they dont work\n\n [https://www.fastcompany.com/90503493/thermal-cameras-are-terrible-at-exposing-covid-19-companies-are-buying-them-anyway](https://www.fastcompany.com/90503493/thermal-cameras-are-terrible-at-exposing-covid-19-companies-are-buying-them-anyway)I mean yeah now it did haha I wish I sold at 3.70 I pulled  $5000 1.99 out at 2.55 and am stuck with 150 at 2.89... may pull out again then ride it around to see what happens this stock will still grow\n\n!remindme in 1 monthFrom the article you just shared:\n\n\nStill, he says, pandemics have been spurring sales of thermal tech since 2003, when SARS emerged.

Doing this is important for a bunch of reasons - for example, if the internet of things is going to become a reality, it can't take years of development and a team of researchers for a company to build a connected toothbrush. \n\nIn other words, apps are going to become almost like commodities - in the sense that they will be cheap, fungible, and easily produced. And there won't be any shortage of people capable of doing that production - especially when you factor in educated workers from emerging markets. \n\nI think Alphabet has stayed ahead of the curve by positioning itself at the center of a lot of the otherwise open-source dev projects, whereas Amazon has it AWS. Companies like Snapchat and Uber, on the other hand, are billion-dollar commodities.", "score": 8, "comment": "Look at you thinking you\u2019re a smart cookie. Everyone knows the value of these apps is the network effect not the software itself. If all it took to build the next facebook was coding it a lot more people would be trying.Op doesn\u2019t realize that the software piece is the easiest, getting the users is always the hardest.Great, so all you need to do is accurately predict when the next market crash will be.\n\nGo ahead.K boys let\u2019s clone a fake Uber repo and instantly make billions!Uber is lame afThe money is in the platform, not the app itself dipshitIt\u2019s all about the advertising dollars and having warm bodies viewing them. \n\nI saw a Trump 2020 ad on Snapchat last week, the 2020 election is going to be huge for social media platforms as political campaigns pour money to capture  new Gen Z voters.You zip it sparky, SPY or die, the rest are just icing on the cakeMy uber position is getting rekktAs a mid-level developer, I can tell you that the dropout rate for developers is massive. Even those that finish school or training programs are still in an uphill battle because nobody wants to hire a novice developer, that's more work than not hiring one at all. This causes many more new developers to get dropped off during the job search phase.\n\nDevelopers aren't in high demand due to a lack of people trying, it's due to a lack of talent because the early learning curve is steep and landing a job is rough.\n\nSoftware also has to be maintained and updated. It will never become worthless or \"cheap commodities\". The only exception are simple mobile games that get spit out like no other and never get touched again.Google will be fucked eventuallyI remember when Google tried to make Google+ the new Facebook. I'm pretty sure they relaunched that a few times too.I like you, you are all right with me SpermInvestor.(Serious tho)Exactly what I was thinking. The sw itself is largely a commodity (yes there are innovations in UI and UX) but the platform, reach and network effect is  why those mentioned companies are worth billions. Facebook and other consumer products would be worthless if there were no usersAnd MySpace was very popular ... right up until the point it wasn't. And how much did Tumblr recently sell for? I'm sure it still has a pretty big userbase. And if it doesn't, that still works in my favor. And how does the network effect apply to Uber?\n\nI'm not smart, I'm just not as much as a retard as you are - which is really my point here. That DURING A CRASH - i.e. when everything is going down - you wouldn't want to be the guy holding a company like Uber.I get that - but stocks are meant to be 10+ year investments. Putting your money in something easily replaceable/upgradable for 10 years is risky.\n\nWhen people are looking for overly risky assets to dump (i.e. in a panic during a crash) I just think Uber and Snap will and should be high up on the listSent from UberPoolwhat else is there if i wanna go somewhere from my house, a fkin cab service that comes 40 min later??Honestly I think now's a good time to buy SNAP. Tripled in value recently, and there's still a lot of room to grow. If next years earnings are positive (which they should be) because the platform is growing. Yeah Snapchat has a growing userbase, mainly due to its popularity with people 11 > 21. Snapchat is worth roughly $15.9 a share. I think that could increase to $25 > $35 within two years, if the predicted recession doesn't happen in that time.\n\nAlso, even if a recession DOES HIT. Snapchat is a free service. Unless 20 million people suddenly decide they can't afford a cheap android smartphone, even if they can't afford a new IPhone, Snapchat won't be hit as hard as other companies, that provide luxury services. I'd probably buy even more SNAP stock if a recession hit. Double your profits when the world comes out the other side.Soxl/FNGU or die*\n\nYolo like a manHowIt\u2019s a network effect because more clients attract more drivers, attract more clients,etc. The larger the user/driver base the better the value proposal for everyone on the platform hence a network effect.\n\nPretty sure I\u2019m wasting my time explaining this to you though because your clearly a 15 years old trying to act like he knows shit.\n\nThe case agaisnt uber in a recession is clearly more the fact that it could be deemed a luxury good which would be the first expense people would cut in a recession. Not that the software is easily replicable.Why amazon?  AWS hosts some of the largest company\u2019s data and compute in the world.\n\nI just think you should be aware that in the olden days (90s) if your company could build it, it would be a success \u2014 mostly because people had good ideas but no one was sure if it was possible to actually build the hardware.  Now that most things are software they can almost always be built, but the question now is if anyone will want to buy or use it.  \n\nApps are already fairly easy to build, spend a couple grand to a few million and you can hire teams to do it fairly reliably.FDs don't last 10 years.     \n     \nYou're doing it wrong, bb.Yes, that\u2019s the drawback and largest risk of consumer companies, missing the trend ie AOL, Yahoo, MySpace. Continuous innovation to remain relevant and to meet consumer needs.$SBUX to 200 by 2021, now what?EU ~~shakedowns~~ fines?  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afNetwork effect fails as it becomes a commodity. Currently, there's Uber and Lyft, and all their drivers drive for both. Soon, there will be a few dozen others, and we'll have TSLA and Waymo cars driving us around. As more drivers drive for more and more tech companies making riding apps, the less Uber and Lyft make. When anyone gets self driving to work, there will be as many cars as that company and it's VC backing can afford. Then we'll have the scooter situation... My metro started with one scooter and one bike company; now there are seven companies renting scooters and five renting bikes. Our streets are littered with them. And I really those bitches off every curb I see. It's awesome.Ah the good old days.85% of their revenues comes from ads. Banner ads are already getting destroyed by Adblock browsers like brave. \n\nI see the web moving towards privacy by default in the future. Which leaves their ad revenue model in troubleI think its a bit more nuanced. Uber and Lyft are the main two, Juno is kinda in NYC but not really. If you wanted to start another driver network it would fail b/c 1 the space is full and 2 the model isn't profitable with human drivers. In the begging you can cobble together an app and enter the market but I don't think this is the main stopping point for ppl with millions to invest in a company.Ad blockers don't exist on mobile, and the vast majority of web browsing is moving to mobile. Also, in a more privacy-focused future, their ads would be less targeted, not less prevalent.     \n     \nLook at stats on ad blockers to see how dumb you are, ya pathetic downvoter. Lol.That's fair. But, others will follow Juno in select areas, and there are (supposedly) driverless options coming.   \n     \nE: it'd also make sense for F and GM and other auto manufacturers to get in on this game. I could see discounted cars for their exclusive drivers or something. Idk.Ad blockers don\u2019t exist on mobile?Ad blockers do exist on mobile browsers... I use one nowyou are right googles ads would be less targeted. Which means less effective as an advertisement tool. If users flock to a privacy by default browsers like brave they can grow out their own ad system they are developing now. Googles ads have become spywareish with trackers/malware whereas braves aim to show you targeted ads but it lets the browser decide on the targeting without spilling your data over the network to publishers, advertisers or Brave itself. It gauges your interest chiefly by the content of websites you visit while browsing. \n\nThere\u2019s also a machine learning aspect to the browser that measures your engagement with the ad and pays you for your attention. \n\nI\u2019ve been using the browser on mobile and desktop solely for its speed and adblocking capabilities. I haven\u2019t seen an ad on YouTube or even pornhub for a whileI don't think others will hop in since drivers are not sustainable and creating a network now would be a big marketing push. Could maybe make something work but I doubt the juice is worth the squeeze. Would have to find some niche to stand out. Uber/Lyft are reliable, Juno supposedly shares profit betterSorry, ad blockers suck on mobile, and are used much less frequently, especially on iPhone.On some browsers, but they're not as good and used much less frequently, especially on iPhone.Lol. Fuck Brave and their shitty shakedown-style business tactics. Also, fuck them fom breaking websites by randomly selecting what JavaScript gets blocked -- like Pornhub's pagination buttons or YouTube's follow-up video recommendations. I want that shit to work, and Brave fails in that respect.        \n     \nLastly, you clearly have no idea how Google Ads works. They don't share any of their user's personal info with their advertisers. You're either shilling for Brave, lying for kicks, or just plain ignorant.That's just it, tho. Drivers sustain better with more apps. That's why they all drive for both Uber and Lyft. If there's a third or fourth option, the drivers also see the benefits of their marketing efforts. But, yeah, too many variables and way too much lucky timing required for me. I'm going to stick to randomly guessing if presidential tweets are going to blast my ass with uppies or blast my ass with downies. Cheers.Lol I\u2019m not shilling anything. I don\u2019t own any BAT. Just enjoy their product and saying eventually googles market dominance won\u2019t be as prevalentSo..... brave just caught google using hidden web pages to give user data to advertisers.... so fuck google and their intrusive practices. I\u2019ll take the occasional broken web sitehttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.techspot.com/amp/news/81746-brave-browser-team-google-using-hidden-pages-circumvent.htmlI believe that...which makes you lying for kicks or just ignorant \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I'm usually the latter. Cheers.I call bullshit.

Lol.You must've missed my edit. That's the exact same link that I said you'd be an idiot to cite. Lmfao.    \n     \nThat accusation was made a year ago, and the \"hidden\" pages they \"found\" don't support their argument.     \n      \nBrave often levels such accusations in an attempt to gain traction and obfuscate what's actually happening. They lie to confuse idiots into using their shitty browser so that they can then push their own advertising. It's as scummy as business models get, and sooner or later someone's going to sue them into oblivion for it.     \n    \nIf you want to not lose money, I suggest you carefully consider [Google's response](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/brave-google-push-pages-violate-gdpr-privacy,40330.html) and ask yourself why the stock jumped for the last couple days despite Brave's releasing this \"evidence\" (lol) three days ago.

Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. \n\n- They\u2019ve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That\u2019s 1/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management \n\n- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. \n\n- EV/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post.

But seriously, I\u2019d at least pick a long dated expiry date like in MayI\u2019m fine with you losing like this, it takes a certain amount of people to torch their money in order to have an options market like we do. My question is: why only 5%? You should lose at least 60% of your portfolio next week.SO HOW DID THIS GOWhy not both?  Buy a put and call. It can go either way. \n\nTesla car owners aren\u2019t the people getting laid off (at least, not entirely).  These people can never afford an $80k car anyways. Even a $40k car is entry luxury level. \n\nThe owners are the programmers working from home. Or the senior management that can work from home, and will jump to another company, if they lose their job. Or the small business owners that can mint cash, once this crisis is over.\n\nAlso, because of Tesla\u2019s online ordering, then you don\u2019t need to visit a dealership. \n\nAnd since it\u2019s electric, it has less need for maintenance, so you don\u2019t need to visit a mechanic. Perfect for the stay-at-home pandemic. \n\nTheir target market has always been the upper class, and white collar workers.Automod wya?FFFTsla is fierce the strongest of the bullsProof or I own $100,000,000 of 800CRemindMe! 6 daysBetter off shorting 2 sharesSometimes you have to learn the hard wayDid you dump on Wednesday or hold?What\u2019s the payout on that 1300?

I\u2019m biased because it\u2019s gone up 1650+ twice this month.\n\nSo it makes no sense.thought so.  that means you don't believe in your own lil TA chart. your 'position' is not having a position, meaning you are not confident enough in your own 'research' to short AMZN. you're telling us AMZN is a bull trap, i.e. it's about to crash down again. yet... you dont actually believe this very strongly, because you dont have a short position. \n\n> I'm net short by holding cash\n\nYou are adorableSo you are poor and since you don\u2019t have skin in the game you are just guessing.

I think I understand the first digit is a quantity of 10 the second is a date of January 15, but what is the 20c?I'm another retard trying to learn but if I'm correct then this means you bought 10 calls (each 100 shares) at $20. GME was >35 on Friday so you made something like 15k?Im so mad right now. I wish I could buy more. As soon as I get the cash I'm rage buyingbuy more shares, make WSB rich  \n\n\nwe buying our own island with hookers and blow free for allI am here to support the good fight brother. I\u2019m in with 2 shares Monday. Fuckin send it.At this point he has entered retard territory and is prime for this sub\u2019s picking. Someone send him the holiday sales report and the shorts volume from Melvin. He might cave and become fuel for us.What the fuck kinda weird fascination with cigars would it take to make *multiple* cigar metaphors within a week? Shit's makin' Monica Lewinsky blush...He is probably all talk with no position.Seeking Alpha is just a cesspool for shitty opinions. 2 Authors 3 pseudointellectual opinions.Career ending fuck up if his sizing was largeRight. why doesn\u2019t Andrew Shapiro read wsb? Fucking idiotI ll be long gone\" says the guy with the grey hair.Rotated into $ROPEI mean I feel like people here forget that these type of people and institutions don't go all in like us retards. They probably follow the Kelly Criterion Formula and play no more than 5% in one play.I\u2019m assuming he just held until expiration, sold the shares at $20, and made a profit. Obviously, not the profit he would have made if he just held the shares. But no moron is going to sell calls at a lower strike than what he paid for the shares, so he still sold higher than he bought inThe hidden truths of wall st: They are all as stupid as we are.He's a fucking boomer. He's doesn't get that the world moved on from his boomer bullshit 15 years ago. He probably prints his emails and files them under correspondence.Semi-related: The 07-09 bloodbath was interesting, as it was the first real big crash to happen with a somewhat mature internet-as-we-know-it today in place. \n\nAll sorts of investing sites had blowhards, ham-and-eggers, fakers, frauds, hypers and retards posting article after article, basically as one-eyed men in the valley of the blind. A bunch of zero-insight droolers mindlessly repeating the most inane investing maxims, and how so-forth was your last chance to get in on a \"gamechanger\" or an \"undervalued SWAN stock\".\n\nThen, the crash happened, then they just vanished. Poof. They once had an audience who listened, then, when the tide went out and everyone saw they were swimming totally naked, so they just stopped posting. Many deleted their accounts, their articles... Since that time, social media really came around and every now and then, I look them up. \n\nOne big talking former article-writer is now a bank teller. Another, an HVAC guy. A couple \"certified financial planners\", some \"cryptocurrency investors\", \"domainers\", etc. These were dudes with bio pics in suits and ties who once confidently told others how to invest their money when the rising tide raised all ships but once actual skill/insight/knowledge was required, they just quietly went away and back to incredibly mediocre day jobs. \n\nSo, other than PLTR to the moon, be careful who you listen to. At least WSB doesn't take itself seriously. \nDon't take anyone seriously who doesn't post their own performance.Usually if they are strongly opposed to a stock, they are somehow financially invested in that opinion> Does every single \"financial guru\" really have no idea wtf they're doing? Or are they all just this stubborn?\n\nyes.YES! everyone is absolutely convinced its already died and don't truly see the potential GME has to transition because they really do NOT understand the gaming industry. It's hilariously sad to watch.Yep stubborn and sometimes don't know shit about technology.Of course he does he's a fucking boomer. They have all the cash they stole from the future generations. We'll make him lose it all thoughis this the explanation for what's going on with Melvin's short position too? They're rolling that 55M in puts over to some future date at a new strike ?Gone like his hairline.One of us and he doesn\u2019t even know it... yet \ud83d\ude02That\u2019s why he was selling weeklies...Read what he said again.Typically selling weeklies is pry smart not here thoLolWhat do you guys think about 50 dollar calls for Tuesday? Or just get more shares?\n\nEdit: never mind will buy more shares and maybe 1 or 2 callsFNever. We all make our choices, and must lie in them good or bad. They ecannot be mourned. They must learn, and grow as most of us did. Mourn not those that never stood a chance. Rejoice when they are born again as \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32Go back through your history and post that shit up, the only thing that excites me more that hot milf porn is retard gain porn, and the only thing that excites me more than that is boomer loss porn.Go on ...Selling naked calls is more retarded than the yolo calls we buy into hereThere are girls in this sub? LolFSometimes it feels like the more and the louder the autism leaks, the more the dying dumb boomers feel like they need to prove themselves. That's when they get rekt and give us our money back. And I'm okay with it.Someone posted it is 138% as of 1/15They don't realize their time has come and gone. All they have is the wealth they stole from the future generations. WSB will have him eating out of a garbage can soon.As he sold naked calls he could lose 100*(current share price -premium-20) * amount of contracts. So if someone exercised em at like the peak of 43 $ he would lose like 2000 dollars per contract he soldIf he was truly selling naked calls, the losses could theoretically be infinite. It just depends how many contracts he actually sold.i dunno about the 20c's specifically but some of the higher strikes (like 30c's) were up over 50,000% after a couple days.\n\nThey went from a premium from pennies to dollar amounts so go figure. There are retail traders out there that are undoubtedly bankrupt from this week. Collecting as little as $5K in premiums from naked calls \"that were never going to print\" would leave them with a loss in the 7 figures (well they've be liquidated before it reached that point, but yeah it will blow up an account)wait, but if you had GME calls, why did you lose 25k?It hasn't yet.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366\n\nHasn\u2019t happened yet.Over on the gamestop subreddit, full of gamestop employees, Cohen has a bad reputation because of his plan to shutter most of the brick and mortar stores.\n\nI'm not very confident in GME long term either, but don't straight up ignore fundamental changes.Who cares about long term about this company. Sell at the peak and move onto the next stock.Cohen will convert it into an online mega gaming palace. Think about it...tons of gaming stuff and no refrigerators or other crap to sift through. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80don't be a doucheCool it with the anti Semitic remarksI did it for youCalls with a strike price of $20He exercised so that means he owns the 1000 shares.he didnt close the contract, he exercised it (actually turned in the option ticket for 100 shares), so you could say that he \"made\" the money but its still in the shares (i fucking hope OP)KOBRA KAI never die!!!Underrated comment, we really should do that. And you know what's the transport to get there :rocket:Like Epstein island, but instead of children there\u2019s cocaine.This is the gotdamn way!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8This dude has some fascination for sure.

It\u2019s one of the tell-tale signs.Basically, does Andrew Shapiro look like someone who know anything about video games, gamer culture, or the video game industry? you wouldn't take his advice on whether to buy a PS5 or a Series-X so why on earth would you take his advice on selling close to the money naked calls on a company with a turn around story like this? fucking boomers.\n\nHis opinion is shit, because he doesn't know shit.Right! Amateurs. I saw a seeking alpha article that said why xpev will surge, and then posted THE SAME DAY was another seeking alpha article saying why xpev will go down. TFyeah, sometimes they have some reasonable articles on certain hype stocks like QS or hydrogen stocks. I personally like it because it provides a decent balance to my usual extremely bullish hydrogen/green energy news sources.He probably does now$RopetatedI forget that outside these hallowed walls, yolo is not the norm, however, 'huge vol prem' on naked calls though. Might be in a tad bit more than 5%...They're stupid but we're fucking retarded!!!!!You don\u2019t?He prints charts to literally draw with crayons on themI thought the SEC requires that for everyone that made $6.34 on an options play onceThat's super interesting. Never thought about those people leaving the industry in a downturn, but it makes sense. Just shows that anyone can claim to be an expert when it's super easy to make money in a market.This should be printed and put on a fucking shirt. BeautifulI'm still feeling really good about pltr, I don't understand the recent negativity I've seen here.  Nothing has changed except people saying it went \"sideways for a week\", even though it closed 5% up. Probably salty their shitty 1/15 $40c weren't miraculously printing already.> don't truly see the potential GME has to transition because they really do NOT understand the gaming industry.\n\nWhat do you see that the bears don't?I'm not a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, promise -- but I'm curious what GME's plans are? I missed the initial post that sparked all this and have just been seeing \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nLike, last I heard they got My Body is Reggie and were planning on like being sort of \"internet cafe/hangout\" places -- is that still a thing? Have they done anything along those lines yet, or is it still just all talk?\n\nObviously (to my eyes) they can't continue their current used games business model if the gaming industry transitions to streaming/digital downloads (hence the newer consoles not even having disk drives), but there must be something I'm missing.\n\nHow do they compete as a brick-and-mortar when a lot of the market is going to Steam/Xbox/Sony's digital stores, or if Stadia-esque streaming becomes a regular thing in 5-10 years? Again, I'm genuinely curious; I missed the initial DD on this one.lose\"stole from future generations\"... Lol. A bit jealous? Nothing Wong with hard work.I don't know any rich boomers.  Most worked for decades at a 9-5 and retired modestly.  It's not like that whole generation is filthy rich and conspired against future generations.  That's some tinfoil hat level stuff there.Too stupid for hereDon't worry, you're in the wrong sub if you think he will understand, GUHThe fact that his comment has so many upvotes is disturbingFThanks GhandiFuck yeahYou bet.Dumbass.And you boys make me laugh out loud and give great advice if you know who to follow. \ud83d\ude09FTill the SEC for whatever reason decides to fuck this sub over for market manipulation. We can be retarded here in the sub, we don't have to go scream WSB it everywhere. Sub is full or 15y olds these days.Thank you fellow tard.Yeah that was my quick math as well. I figure he lost at least $1500/contract if they didn't exercise at the peak, but he supposedly sold multiple contracts. Sure would be a shame if his losses were in the 5 figures.\n\n\nAnd by shame, I mean hilarious.He sold themhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366 \n\nHasn\u2019t happened yet.> Cohen has a bad reputation because of his plan to shutter most of the brick and mortar stores.\n\nTo be fair they have waaaaay too many stores, when you hear stories of two gamestops in a single mall then they should be shutting stores, they are as bad as starbucks.Which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Closing stores might be good to maximize profit.thanks, like I said i\u2019m a fucking retard.We will fuck his wife and her boyfriendim taking my own fucking rocket to at least a mil. see you in greece or bahamas!Woah guy, you flying too close to the sun on this one.it seems everybody with the name Shapiro is retardedI'm not sure Gamer Culture has a lot to do with the market thesis hereIdk he looks broke to me. RIPYou really need to stop with this boomer trash talk.  i'm one, and no, I don't know a thing about the video game industry, but I learned a lot about GME from u/deepfuckingvalue.  I'm long 1000 shares.  Dr. Burry is a boomer too, and he's long a few more than I am.  We're in this together.  Ease up dude.It's basically a message board. Market manipulators can go on there and post what they want. So it's not surprising to see contradictory posts.I'm just basing the 5% off of what the experiment suggests id say maybe up to 20-25% would be the most they would play and probably not on a short position but who knows maybe they have just a touch of downs.tards like us, but with suits.No i print them out and scan them in. I'm not an idiot!!!Thanks for the laugh\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are too busy finger popping each other\u2019s assholes to play gamesIt\u2019s not what I see and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s about how they can see the same news and have a completely different perspective. They\u2019ve been assuming GameStop is going to go bankrupt for the last 10 years. \n\nThey only see what they want at this point. \n\nThe bears have nothing new that\u2019s in their favor. Bulls are the only ones that have news that\u2019s in their favor.He\u2019s just describing old guys bungholeOk boomerOk boomerWe actually make money on GME hereYou're welcome. I got your back.FCorrect. It hasnt happened. \n\nThe short interest literally only went up, not down. You know that right?Remember back in march when gamestop decided that their employees were *essential workers*? Everybody's freaking out about the plague and these guys got stuck dragging themselves to work without any PPE or clear preventative measure or nothing.\n\nThey're people getting fucked over by the pandemic that need a job. If you know anybody who's tried to find a job in the last year, you know how harrowing it is. And if somebody gets infected in your household and you're on the hook for the bill for a ICU stay? You're fucked. How do you pay rent? utilities? food? And now a new board wants to come in, lay everybody off and move the business online.\n\nIn most narratives, we're the bad guys here. We're the greedy investors that scream at the board cuz WE WANT TENDIES NOW.\n\nJust something to think about.Welcome homei dont remember this line in the show but i like itMakes him perfect for the sub, shouldn\u2019t we have our professionals recruiting this man for rocket fuel?Boomer is more of a mindset than an age.\n\nI know many completely retarded and close-minded 30 and 40 year olds that I consider to have the boomer mindset and I know 60 and 70 year olds that are cool as fuck that I\u2019d never in a million years call a boomer. Like you sir.> Dr. Burry is a boomer too\n\nMichael Burry is gen x\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c\n\nedit: wow, you tried talking about getting this sub shutdown because you took offense to the word retard, you really are a boomer.So it's like a less openly retarded WSB?Sometimes I put on a suit and tie and sit on the toilet  on my phoneThen what do you put in your file cabinet?This made me chuckle.

I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they \"have\" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:\n\n**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**\n\n**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among \"3-4 others in the state\" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as \"PC building stations\".**  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.\"**\n\nNow, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. \n\nHOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty \"in-the-know\" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!\n\nShe also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the \"Next blockbuster!1!!!\" thesis.\n\nPersonally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.\n\n\nPositions: 250 shares @22.30 cost avg, 2x 4/19/21 $30c, 2x 01/29/21 $50c\n\n(Somebody on mobile add the rockets pls)\n\nETA69: Somebody showed me how to do the rockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 LFG!!!\n\nETA420: DON'T GIVE ME GOLD, KEEP THAT MONEY AND FUCKING BUY GME SHARES\n\nETA from one of the commenters below, u/theodros1:\n\n\"Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores.

Gamestops in areas outside my state claimed that 1.5 stores were simply larger and had more room to carry supply but did not involve \"building stations.\" One clerk claimed that while they were transitioning to  PC parts, he did not see any stores being building stations. Take this all for what's it worth.This is actually huge, see people don\u2019t understand the niche of the gaming market. They want to buy and support someone who understands them. GameStop revolutionizing themselves into a one stop bestbuy but nerdier is going to be huge and that doesn\u2019t consider all the e-commerce\n\nThat and computers are like phones, everyone wants the latest and greatestI would, 100% build at a kiosk, especially if there were physical representations of things like cases available to see and touch in store.

They\u2019re sold out of virtually everything at GameStopDE, most  new  booster packs (champions path, vivid voltage etc. were sold out in the first hour. GameStop is already the #1 location for Pok\u00e9mon releases in Germany  since the only other stores getting those packs are one man card shop businesses. There\u2019s another big release coming up In February (shining fates). I\u2019m certain GameStop is in a similar position in the US. Those packs are even reselling at double MSRP, there\u2019s huge potential for GameStop if they manage to secure more stock and sell the hyped booster packs in bundles with less hyped booster packs to profit off of that. I went in store at GameStop 3 days after the release and the clerk told me I was the 25th person to ask him about that booster pack already. I\u2019ll try to find out how many boxes of SF they get if the store is opened again next month (current lockdown). People are saying GameStop is dying but really they are in a good position selling PC parts, games and collectibles like Pok\u00e9mon cards and funko pops. Even without a squeeze I\u2019ll be long GameStop, they are truly underappreciated and I am certain RC can make this a 10B stock in no time.This just gave me the biggest boner. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80This should be front of wsb news.

If he's looking to grow the company, the best way to not only send a message and to get the shorts off the back of the company is to make damn sure the squeeze occurs. ON TOP OF THAT, the amount of brand spanking new loyal consumers that will 100% use their new found money on product and services the store offers if this is successful is gigantic. The free marketing, the loyalty, the brushing off of pressure, all of that would pave a clear road towards Chewy 2.0.\nRyan I hope you're reading this.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80hmmmmmm wasn\u2019t convinced till now but after this i might have to hop on the retard rocketIf Cohen is announced as CEO i might bussThat\u2019s it.

FUCK IBP. Estimated ship date was last week, the only thing they've done in 6 weeks is process my payment. I'd cancel but I feel like at this point a decent company might take longer then IBP will.My local GameStop is always busy and has been for years. I don\u2019t know why people think it\u2019s like block buses. Oh wait, yes I do. It\u2019s because they are retarded.I told my buddy about GME and he said the same thing about pokemon packs - the new ones are completely are sold preorders (Shining Fate boosters). Shorts are fucked\n\nedit: went out to a couple gamestops looking with him, found no pokemon cards of any kindCan confirm average mid range pc is around 600-800$ And those just for entry level these things can easily go over 4K$ GME to the moonWhat if this was supposed to be announced at the IRC and got pulled for some reason. And the manager assumed it was already public knowledge?now imagine if they had employees persuade people into getting online GME game passes that can get you a whole lot of PC games for a monthly fee. we are actually going to the moon boysI will literally drop 10k buying two gaming PCs at GameStop when this happens.\n\nBuying more shares on Monday.

I cannot tell you how frustrating it can be to order PC parts off the internet.  Package delays, damaged product. Or it just doesn't work and you have to go through the hassle of returning the DOA product for a refund and wait another week for your part to arrive while your brand new partially finished PC collects dust.\n\nThere are no in store retailers near me that sell parts and i'm forced to go through someone like Amazon.  I've been itching for a large retailer where i can just walk in and pick my parts at the store and build my new computer THAT DAY.\n\nFucking hell, i'm getting hard at the though of it.  I don't think people realize how many cities across America don't even have a microcenter or anything of the like they can just walk into.\n\nThere is a massive untapped market of retail buyers itching for something like this and they don't even know it yet.  Who knows, 4 or 5 years from now instead of kids lining up to buy the next gen consoles, they will be lining up at gamestop to build their first computer.Glad to see they are making moves. \ud83d\ude80Dude, this makes so much sense.Can confirm the PC stuff, they keep empty boxes bc their shit sells out pretty quickly\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I was literally talking to my co worker about how GME should do this then this post comes outHoly fuck.

Some sort of bundle with GamePass, tech support, free entry into some events or tournaments they host for a year.  Then once you do this you never shop anywhere else for the next 20 years.\n\nLemme throw a rocket in here too \ud83d\ude80It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.\n\nTLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\n\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\n\nto all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Yesterday several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon.

Would 100% use this.You know I\u2019m super happy to see GME be THE comeback kid of 2021. Super fun to watch a company go from gutted stores to evolving into an almost interactive online store, which means the tendie printers up top at GME are coming up with some excellent ways to switch it up.\n\nEdit: A thought I had right after. With GameStop\u2019s everywhere in the US, we could see a store with Hopefully decent of parts and can see our product before we buy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever truly bought computer parts from a brick and mortar store, mostly because nothing around me like that racists, a GameStop exsist a thoughSo $CRSR?This actually makes the Microsoft deal make more sense. Upgrading your tech in store for your employees doesn't make sense if they're just selling Funko popsNot buying it.

More reason to believe in daddy Cohen. GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80CRSR GME merger confirmedRyan Cohen recently started to follow PC Gamer on Twitter within the past week (the authority on PC games)... $420.69 PT confirmed\\>   \"Cohen news hasn't materialized yet\"... I said him being \"CEO\" and he grunted, I think affirmatively \n\n  \nIf you are playing with my heart, you are doing it wellI have not purchased a console since 2014 specifically because pc gaming is far superior with games and graphics. on top of that a great set up can last for 5+ years before you upgrade parts to more modern parts.

Seems like last week's buying was from longs and not short covering just like what some of the research analysts have been saying. \n\nSome large hedge funds probably have done the same on-the-ground research as you have and they agree with the transformation thesis.\n\nMy take is, it will take two quarters to fully digest what the new store transformation will do to SP. But in the meantime it can certainly rally on optimism. \n\n$50 seems possible in the interim with $100 by eoy if transformation is successful by Sep for back to school sale.\n\nI think a great trade is to buy 2022 or 2023 leaps on Tuesday if price is still cheap.I wonder if they could ammend their deal with Microsoft to include kickbacks on PC sales.I can't find a thing about this anywhere. Hopefully some PC media outlets catch this rumor and do the same diligence some commenters have, and then run a story on it. Seems like a perfect catalyst to blow this open next week.Awesome stuffWe love to see it.I hope they also pursue having VR equipment in stock.Oh shit, this IS big!  If they have a PC build guru there who can help you build your PC in the store at the spot, this is going to be huge.  If their inventory is good, Microcenter & Newegg are fuuucked.How long until my wifes boyfriend can get a Gamestop Pass exclusive fortnite skin?Speaking from a first time experience building a PC. Speccing it out is fun. Putting it together fucking takes hours and is fucking nerve wrecking because one wrong move and you will brick the machine causing you to spend additional cash just to replace the parts for your fuck up. I would definitely pay someone a service fee who is more experienced and comfortable putting it together day in and day out.So is there zero news about the pivot to PC gaming? This is literally the first I\u2019ve heard.PC building centres? Buy $AMD on the side??WE nee dmore research on this.They need to do Streamer setups Ikea style.\n\nLet the kids sit down and test the equipment.\n\nMake some margin on RGB.I read 1/3 of this DD and already decided that my next PC build will be thru GMEImagine they pull a porshe and announce that shit monday night. I got FOMO'd and got 4 shares friday and getting 10 more tuesday morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Good fucking work OP. I\u2019m going to do research in my local area to see if it\u2019s happening near where I live (large metropolitan area).yo who's wet or hard rn bc got damn... Imagine the tendies once GME gets balls deep in e-sports after creating a bunch of pros w/ these 1.5 storesI've been saying this from the very beginning that GME needs to focus more on PC and am glad to hear they're looking that route.  I have the older generation of consoles, but have been almost exclusively playing on PC for the past 5 years.  PC users also tinker with their rigs too by upgrading various components so you should see recurring revenue.  It sounds like a dope idea.They can become Starbucks for gamersWe should blast Ryan Cohen with \u201cideas\u201d along these same lines in hopes he\u2019ll half-confirm them or something so we can share that on Twitter.Maybe the institutional shorts know this. They are trying to short it as much as possible now, and as time goes on, they buy more and more calls at the correct strikes such that if it slingshots up, the calls are executed at a strike that sells all of their shorts at a profit, and reverses their short position into a long position. So basically short the high, cash out the short and go long at the bottom, and rocket it up to a new high.A news write up of this MOONS the stockIf GameStop pivoted to include like gaming cafes in Asia they would make $$$ and make it a subscription model. America does not have mass gaming cafes. They already have the infra for this.LOLThis is so absolutely THE WAY.\n\nI\u2019m going to sell a large put position on Tuesday I think\n\nEdit: autocorrect[removed]Just an aside, your April calls expire on 16 not 19...in case you have it marked in your calendar as such \ud83e\uddad I am with you @ $29 \u270aAlso remember the website is down having a complete overhaul. Or is that just me in \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7?This reminds me of what Radioshack was doing in the years before bankruptcy. Not to shit on GME, but its true.Is this information legit ?Nice post!\n\nBTW this whole concept reminds me a bit about AutoZone... highly recommend this short video about them from CNBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYNlaLt4jicThey need to M&A with Microcenter. That would be huge!The irony of the company doing the shit I told them to do 2 years ago before they fired me.I used to build my own computer. Like 20 years ago. It is really fun.   \n\n\nMy favorite thing was back then (maybe now still, I dunno) you could buy a cheap Intel chip and get a motherboard that allowed for overclocking and you could basically get the incredibly expensive, top of the line Intel CPU performance out of the really chip CPU and save a bundle. Typically, tho, building your own PC was far more expensive than buying something off the shelf unless you found a good cheap place for the parts.\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude80No f-Ing way .  This is way too niche to mane any real $$$.  The PC parts business is super competitiveWhat\u2019s a PC?For people that enjoy paying 6 times markup on low margin partsGuys, the only decent bull case right now is the short squeeze continuing.\n\nNews and performance of the company don't matter if you are buying now, it's purely technical.\n\nIf you wait for that bubble to pop a bit and come in after the dust settles in this thesis, I'm with you on it.\n\nAll this to say GME 420C 01/29/2021.I realize why all the people here call everyone autists.\n\nY'all might make some money on this but how many times the mods gonna tell you this is illegal. It's not worth tanking all of WSB for a payout, especially not from GME....So, basically what you're saying is that their gaming business is dead and they are desperately coming up with ridiculous ideas to save the company.PC gamers would never build their rigs at a GameStop... lmfao, maybe some fortnight kidOrder your fucking parts online and assemble in your basement like a fucking normal person. GameStop looks and smells like Spencers fucking Gifts to me. Or worse, Build-a-Bear. What useless tripe. Retail for idiots.\n\nI suppose that there are a LOT of computer idiots who might think themselves on their way to hacker status if they finally build their own computers...Huge news if true. I'll increase my Put position on Tuesday if they confirm this business strategy. \n\nFirst of all, Gamestop employees are in no way qualified to speak with any confidence about the technical PC parts needed for high-end gaming rigs. \n\nThey are part-time High School kids who weren't even born when Battletoads came out. \n\nBesides, this business model has been tried once before. The company was called RadioShack. They also had Trump Steaks and Sharper Image massagers - and they failed.\n\nBut I guess Gamestop has Funko dolls, so there's that.Right? Microcenter doesn't have anywhere near the spread of GME stores either. My closest microcenter is like an hour away.\n\nI told the manager I would use that service to buy my next gaming PCRC must have othe plans than just convenience microcenters. I am expecting expecting a turn to tech.is a tiny microcenter a nanocenter?  \n\n# \ud83e\udd14Been screaming this and getting yelled at from the non GME people... they could have exclusives too with Corsair or Razr or whoever... huge move if true. Pcpartspicker meets micro centerGME is going to be what you get when you mix Microcenter with Build-A-Bear.  GET HYPE!ThisThere was a fucking line to get in the one by the Hibachi place a couple hours ago. Makes me want to go in and check on my investment.This is the kind of move I can get behind, but knowing how stingy Gamestop is on deals that don't involve used games I'm not holding my breath that they will ultimately be a good place for pc builders to buy their parts, and I have to imagine any prebuilts that would come out from them are going to be pricey as well.You're not getting microcenter storage at tiny strip mall locations :/ \n\nMaybe gamestop will just become newegg but without the scalping and fucking horrible customer service and RMA bullshit when you need a simple return.Thank you!!!!I\u2019ve been preaching they need a steam/epic like app and compete in that market, that\u2019s a huge move though and that would need to have been in the works a while. But if that is the case GME could become a monster of hardware and software gamingMost PC parts are low-margin thoughYes. And remember this is just one small part of their overall re-posturing effortLookup microcenter in the meantime\n\nEdit: ah thought you meant los angelesLegit nerds? Where is your line on nerd? Some fuckhead who can plug a graphics card into a motherboard? If this is anything like Geek Squad, GTFO.Fry's is bankrupt / closing isn't it? I've heard they're finally closing after not restocking inventory for a long time.ehm... have you tried to assemble a PC? It is as difficult as small set of lego for 10-12 year old. I literally build my own PC 5 years ago without prior building experience. Had some trouble connecting pins on the motherboard but all this shit was overall easy. Stop exaggerating, you don't need to be \"passionate\", lolEven a boomer can learn to build their own PC.  It's literally like LEGO's.RadioShack tried this and failed - hard.It's this sort of shit that's on the ground all about customer-business interactions that those homos at Melvin don't do. Just assholes killing a company that wants to give people something they want. We have actually out done them with market research. Unbe-fucking-leivable. I love you guys.now this is DD. actual investigations going onFuck yeah. Yeah I think she probably gave away more than she was supposed to... I'm not gonna cite the specific store because I don't want to get her in trouble. She was very informative and helpfulAlso in October, the deal with MSFT was [announced](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/).\n\nThey\u2019re shifting all their business operations to the Microsoft 365 stack, including CRM Dynamics.  They\u2019ll be setup for better data driven decisions and collaboration.  It also equips all staff with Surface devices on the sales floor.  Maybe something like the Apple store where there\u2019s not really a register anymore.  Just checkout with the employee anywhere.\n\nThis deal also includes a GME cut of all digital sales from Xboxes sold from GME for the life of the console.  That\u2019s some nice extra revenue for essentially little effort.  And this happened in October!  I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ll see how much they made from that deal with nextgen console sales in their next quarterly.Holy shit this just gave me the biggest fucking chills in my life.... if they plan to discuss this to the public fully anytime soon then good luck trying to even get in.Cohen isn\u2019t CEO yet??Have a reward for your effort\ud83d\ude80Holy fuck. \n\nI'm in for $2k on TuesdayA random guy at a GameStop that knows about Cohen? Sounds unlikely.This is fantastic! Thanks for sharingNow this is journalism I can subscribe to.Same! trying to figure out compatibility etc before ordering is a pain in the ASSMakes me wonder if they'll have Geek Squad type employees who will build it for you for a price or if they'll just help you assemble the parts.I can't tell if the posts are made by tards or bots. But count me in on thinking they are dumb either way.I'll bring some if they don't yet!I think they call them marsgaritas.For sure. But the manager seemed convinced they were pushing forward. Go call your local GME stores and see what they say.Given the general sentiment in this post we should probably call RC and make it true\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFuck yeah thanks man! Im a boomer lmaoHoly fucking shit, you are a fucking smoothbrained heroWow, you just changed my life! \ud83d\ude31My old graphics card was so heavy it literally loosened my PCI express slot on my mobo. I really need a new one, so Melvin pay up already.Same, my graphics card is slowly dyingOnly at GME?Maybe board chairman is better> Linus tech tips \n\nOh yeah, their secret shopper episodes were so good but at the same time showed very much, how much potential there is. Especially with those people who don't know how to build a PC and who also don't want to know. And those are a LOT.Do I hear GME dedicated discord server with wsb mods at the forefront?It was definitely pulled for a reason.  You gotta lock up your trash so the bears cant get into it.With your gains, just buy the entire fucking store. \ud83d\ude80Furniture, peripherals... The \ud83c\udf1d's the limit.Sign me up for an RGB headset, keyboard, and mouse. As long as its 15% off if I bought all of it separate, I would go for it.I bought at 19, it went to 21. I bought at 21, it went to 31. Bought at 31, went to 39. Bought at 37, went down to 35. I havent taken a big L this whole time I've been fueling this rocket with you retards and you haven't lead me astray yet. \n\nWe ride this shit the fuck out because when this moons, $5, $10, $20 differences will not matter in the scope of tendies and we will dip them in the blood of Melvin Capital bank coffers!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80My 550 shares are locked and loaded to sell at 420.69. I think there will be a lot of market resistance at that point.Yeah, the shittiest part of assembling a PC rig is that you have to buy MSFT Windows separately (relatively expensive). \n\nI used to pirate windows in the past, but now that I have a respectable income I buy it. MSFT office is expensive as well (and a must for most people).\n\nMaybe this is in part where the microsoft deal comes in with GME?This needs to be at the topEveryone I see is saying buy stocks.stocksAt least 100 shares ... gamble the rest of you want or pick up more shares.Stocks and fucking hold them things.stock and then limit sell at 420.69 so they can\u2019t loan your shares to shortsFrom personal experience, when I build a PC, I go ham and future proof that baby for at least 5 years. I've seen people comparing rigs to phones, but i disagree. It all comes down to if my PC can play the newest fallout, COD, Cyberpunk, etc. on max settings or not.Dude. It's a value play inside a squeeze play. We should be 50 on fundamentals. At least. If news like this was true and got out, shorts are dead. Squeeze soon.Not yet. But we know this sub is HEAVILY monitored and they constantly read what we\u2019re talking about. So if the cats out of the bag wouldn\u2019t you think they\u2019d let the fucking cat out of the fucking bag ASAP? I sure hope so. Especially when they see the hype surrounding it? Make this official Daddy Cohen!AMD and NVDA for sure.Not the best timing for that business model unfortunately.Excuse me?Buy shares.  You would only make the premium on the puts instead of the mad upside of Gme rockets.Are you lost ? Go back to sleepHoly shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*Just checked it here in US. It\u2019s working fine.That was 2015 tough. A lot more people are invested in computers and tech now, we got 40+yr old game streamers now in 2021, so the market has broadened.\n\nI'm just a retard toughInteresting perspective. Is this the final throws, the last gasp of GME? RC isn't your daddy, is he \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bAt $420 a share. I won\u2019t mind paying the premium when I go there to shop in a few months bro.Newegg shoppers need not apply. GME's market will be normies and kids. As it always has been.\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Get fucked. Hope you close that short position ASAP. We\u2019re about to take your milk money and eat your lunch.Honestly it was high quality I might, I'm 37, I have money and I don't have the desire to go through the whole pc part picking experience relearning whats good every 5 years.Imagine being 40 and shitting on people who need a hand buying and putting together their first gaming pc.Your user name does NOT check out. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bGet fucked \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bYou don\u2019t need a degree to understand the \u201ctechnical computer parts required for high end gaming rigs\u201d it\u2019s not a fucking nuclear reactor.Bro who is huge into pc gaming told me same thing - getting High end gaming pc stuff is either online or driving hours to micro center. Having a gme around the block would be game changer for him and others like himI live in Florida and hate how we have nothing close to microcenters here.Just checked and my closest Microcenter is 8 hours away. About the same for Fry\u2019s.\n\nI have 10 GME stores within a 1 hour drive.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I legit didn't even know about microcenter until GME started getting comparisons. Known about Gamestop my whole life. \ud83d\ude80My closest microcenter is over 12 hour driveI bet these pc-building stores are what they planned to talk about at the conference when they switched from retail to tech. \n\nBut for whatever reason they weren\u2019t ready to announce that just yet so they canceled.When can I expect a GME electric vehicle?Other plans you say? When can I expect the rollout of a GME electric vehicle?I'd like a kiosk to build a mouse. Left side panels for buttons, shell configurations for different hand sizes and weights, different plastic slider thingy shapes and sizes, different cords.As long as every component can be RGB, I'm in![deleted]This is true; but additional services (think Best Buy\u2019s Geek Squad for example, or GamePass) are basically pure profit.\n\nSame with accessories, mouse pads, mice, software, fancy lighting. Anything outside of core components.Loss leader but without the loss partno branded micro centers near me if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, and the run down mom and pop shops are not where karen will take georgiepoo to build his $2,000 systemyeah los angeleshttps://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/kyrmto/associates_assembling_pc_for_customer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfknowing all your funko pops and knowing how to properly install any brand of component without shorting or destroying pins are very different level of nerds\n\nedit: and do it without googling it in front of the customerMy line for nerds is if you got bullied in highschool or notLmao thinking pc building is just plugging GPU on a moboI think it's more on the lines of having an intuitive knowledge of compatibility without needing to Google - once the parts are confirmed to work together it's a piece of cakeAh yes but here we are forced to examine the difference in \u201ccan\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d \n\nExample/ How many cats out there changing their own oil? They all *could* they just *dont*LEGO's are for nerds. I figured that out because I'm crushing on one. Who knew nerds could be so hot?You understand the stock price doesn't actually impact the companies results right? The price going up or down does NOT create more or less revenue. It may make it harder for them to issue more shares to raise funds but debt is super cheap right now if they were to need money to grow.\n\n The companies results normally impact the stock price but not always.  It is a loose correlation driven by INVESTORS sentiment and macro events. The economy could tank dragging down the stock price and GME could actually have great sales and their stock could trade flat. It also depends on how other companies are doing.  Gme as an investment is competing with other companies for investor dollars based on return vs risk.added his comment to my OPWe should call more gamestops and see what we can gather. I think Cohen is going to announced as CEO soon.Sometimes I give info to customers who seem \"legit\" the unspoken rule is don't rat put the person who gave you info. I've witnessed firsthand people getting fired over something like this.This confirms the transformation is happening. On-the-ground DD matches your news. I'm convinced. Buying leaps Tuesday open. This will moon within a year for sure.Might also be related to a potential analytics/advertising platform. Found some rumors on twitter.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LbVQgNqNope, just now only has a board seat as of MondayNo, and we don't want him to be. We want him to run for board chairman in June (which should be an uncontested run if he owns 19.9%). CEO answers to the board, but the board chairman answers to no one.Thanks man.I still have fans that were \"supposed\" to be compatible with my build so this is definitely the move for GMEIn my head I see this as a kiosk order that is sent to, say, a regional assembly hub. From there it ships complete either to the store or to your door. Associates in store would be there for advice on component choices, accessories, and upsells such as subscriptions or protection services. \n\nPerhaps the best part of the kiosk is the potential to build in performance estimates and benchmarks for a particular build as you put it together. Estimate graphics settings and framerates and shit like that. The store employee can know almost jack shit about PCs because the kiosk does it for you. Jusy need one guy at corporate that stays on top of it and pushes out updates.\n\nIf it were my business, assembly would be built into the price at the kiosk.Are we sure Cohen is on board with this strategy if it began before he was on the BoD?  I can't see why he wouldn't think it's a great move, but it seems like this is the perfect thing to announce at the conference, and they pulled out.Was about to cal three of the local gamestops but they closed 45 mins ago. On the other hand, theyALL have 4.5+ stars and 200+ reviews, lol.YO RC IS THIS POST TRUE?I hope you don\u2019t get a 3090 then, that shit is a tankMy laptop wants to light on fire when i open chrome soooo.I did a small double take there on your joke. If you live near bears, they really do go through the trash. Kinda like cats. \ud83e\udd2dThis is an underappreciated commentTasty$100 by 2022 is too low for you? You should work for GS!\n\nGeez the hate is real. Okay then, I'm upgrading to $100 by eom Jan. Good enough? No? Wow..okay $100 by eow.Selling puts = bullishHaha no. I\u2019m up big and getting moreMaybe I\u2019m retarded. I think they\u2019ve just left the U.K. for good. \ud83d\ude2d Can\u2019t even shop online now. Oh well, maybe if this squeeze happens I can profit to reopen a U.K. store.\n\nLiterally a week ago it went down so I thought, oh shit, it\u2019s Ryan Cohen.But isn't console gaming *MUCH* bigger in America?\n\nIs it because Americans generally don't care for PC-gaming or that it is not advertised enough?Not a degree, just some expertise - which the average Gamestop employee doesn't have. \n\n\n\"Which one of these graphics cards is best for that new Cyberpunk game, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or the AMD Radeon RX 5700?\"  \n\n\n\"Ummm....I dunno. Wanna buy some Pokemon cards?\"First person experience here. It took me 2 months to get all the parts in my budget. Gamestop is very well positioned if they decide to get into the trade. Also PC building is an addictive hobby. You start as a gamer trying to save some bucks and end up pimping your case. Head over to r/buildapc and r/sffpc to see what kind of community. It would really be a game changer for Gamestop.Not if they don't stock anything though.  I guess I'm not seeing the appeal of walking into a brick and mortar store down the street to use a kiosk to place and order for a part or system that will be shipped to my house.  Isn't that what a website is from home?\n\nNot trying to shit on GME here, I'm literally all in, but them getting rid of toys and candy and shit, and replacing it all with stocked PC parts you can take home that day sounds more appealing to me.As someone that has build a couple computers before (nothing huge but I know the basics) I can assure you that this market is prime for disruption. Pc building isnt that bad actually but most people dont want to get into it and therefore order a pre build computer online. The problem is that there are hundreds of sites and its very confusing for people to decide which specs to pick. Because of this you have a 90% chance to get ripped off. I seriously believe gamestop could be a mini microcenter but not only for pc builders, but for regular gamers too. \nThey could even combine this with their own digital store, like steam/epic games. You can buy digital games, order pc/console accesories, read gameinformer to stay up to date, have special deals for powerup members and buy digital DLCs or order fysical collectibles from games you play a lot. ALL IN ONE APPLICATION. \nI am just thinking out loud here but everytime I read something like this my dick gets hard and my brain is going sicko mode. Sorry for this long, probably stupid comment but im about to increase my buy order for tuesday \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80As long as it\u2019s priced right cause BestBuy and Walmart have a small selection of high tier pc components but they have insane markups that makes it not worth it.Can second this. I have to drive 4 hours to and from of I want to buy something that day. Fucking sucks.I've been fortunate enough that microcenter is only 10 minutes away but I agree, gme being a microcenter for those people who aren't near one would be great. Better yet, maybe Cohen should talk the board into acquiring microcenterYour bro is spot on. I truly miss having a Micro Center and a Fry's Electronics within 50 miles of each other was glorious. They'd price match each other, but MC 95% was the lowest price, but was instantly sold out. Roll to Fry's and buy.\n\nGot my $1.5K monitor for $799 doing just that. \n\nIf another company filled in for the rest of the country they could steal a lot of online business.My nearest microcenter is over 4600 miles away. I live in the USA. I can find a gamestop much easier.Roadmap was likely to change significantly with RC and the new board, so why present information that is already potentially outdated?Would be a game changer to be able to try it out in personWhat do you mean? Like all the DD that has been posted or just this post?This post is pretty well formulated broFancy lighting? Does this mean my new GME rig will be yeet enough to to post to R/battlestations?lmao they are NOT happyexactly, & if you\u2019re paying someone to assemble something you don\u2019t want them saying \u201cuh hang on let me see how you install this.\u201d They need to have that in the noggin.That's not a good comparison i feel.  Changing your oil is a lot different as opposed to building a computer that will give you endless hours of entertainment, plus porn.Companies value is set by share price. Getting shorted to oblivion limits options for credit and other avenues for raising funds in hard times. A very healthy company can be run out of business through shorts especially when something like COVID happens. If GME didn\u2019t have a healthy war chest in March there is a good chance they would be gone today. A company that has been on the decline for about 6 years (revenue) and whose stock is a penny stock. They would have to issue hundreds of millions of shares to raise real money and who\u2019s going to buy them? If anything would cause a sell off. What bank would loan them money? \n\nWhile shorts don\u2019t effect day to day operations it does make bankruptcy more likely.Yes, If the STAKEholders equal the SHAREholders. Just cause Melvin has a share, doesn't mean they have a stake in the company. The future for GME under Cohen is so bright, I gotta put on some shades \ud83d\ude0eCohen has big balls, we know that. He has the power to fuck the shorts and begin the mass genocide of shorts, but will he actually use his power you think? Like are there any ramifications with big banks and financial institutions.

We need this to gain traction and hopefully news networks pick up the \u201crumors\u201d. We need a major catalyst to finish the shorts once in for all and start the squeeze. All of this information needs to spread like wildfire.Board Chairman answers to WSB.I like that idea a lot.  I know building a PC can be daunting for people who aren't very DIY, but this would satisfy them and also be a great place to learn more about the different build components.  I definitely think they'd have to have a regional distribution center because their stores are way too small to physically hold all that inventory.  But if you can offer a gaming PC that's built and either delivered to your door or you pick it up at your local GME store in a short time frame, I think they have a winner. \n\nI went through Cyberpower PC on my latest rig and it took about 5 weeks from order to receiving my gaming PC.  If they can beat that time window they can absolutely start taking market share away from those other companies who build PCs.Maybe, he want to get in first and fulfill his share requirement before this moons.Tweet if it\u2019s true!!Yup they've destroyed mine once or twice !In this bubble? Yeah those aren't great returns.Double negative confuses retards.New product, new training.Plus imagine the used parts market they could offer. Most PC gamers cycle through upgrades before they do a full rebuildIf gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80If gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80Think about someone building their first PC, they are going to be very nervous considering the amount of money being spent and without a friend they trust they may just not do it or make critics mistakes that drive them back to consoles. A pc building kiosk with a employee that actual knows pc parts and can help someone setup a pc that does what they need it to do in their price range is huge.The toys/collectible business is huge for them though, so I wouldn't say they should get rid of that.  Dunno about candy though (cheap but high margin, not sure if worth the shelf space?)If gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80My dick got so hard it got stuck in a pumpkinWhere do you live, fucking Alaska?Sure I\u2019m speaking more to the idea that just cause you can doesn\u2019t mean you do. \nIn short- Connivence is a real part of what/how/why we do thingsStock price on affects their ability to raise money, not day to day operations.I am long.  I have 4200 shares i wrote covered calls on so I do hope it dips next week before it goes to the moon just under $30, I will pay my dumb tax and then back over $40.\n\nI also have about 40 April 15 $15C.He can't do it by directly commenting on company value, but he can definitely do it by rolling out roadmaps and company visions for upcoming service and operating model changes, which I expect to start to popping up in coming weeks.You can just straight up say  I am interested in building my pc at GameStop, do you guys have parts available? Ask if they are 1.0 or 1.5 store if you feel ballsyYeah imagine if he releases another filing on Tuesday showing that he bought the dip on Friday. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf14To be fair my Tim Apple phone spazzed out and typed something un-intelligible.i'd totally sell them my old pc to build a new one every 2 yrsThat's a really good point actually, if they become a reliable source for used pc parts they will change the gameNo, they wouldn't get rid of the knick knacks. Think about it. Some dad's going there specifically to grab parts for his new  gaming build. For that kid, without anything shiny, It might as well be a doctor's visit. Except more boring because he won't even get that visceral thrill of a needle in his vein or the subsequent joy of a lolli pop.\n\nWell at game stop we have life sized pikachus staring down at the dad while he jacks off to the newest i12 processor. The kids distracted by the life sized pikachu's embrace and coos.\n\nSo while the kids blocking it out, dad inseminated the second generation semi organic computer with his genetic code. \n\nA dead, souless eyed wage slave boxes up the inseminated computer. It incubates during the ride home. Assembles itself. The things ready right out of the box, just wipe off its amniotic fluid.\n\nAnd then you insert the Pikachu into the port. The cooing becomes moans. It gets real X rated real quick. Dad uses the opportunity to explain the birds and the bees to little screwy. \n\nWhile screwy's crying for his lost toy, it's growing into his new best friend. And dad's half son.\n\nI say this as a win, win, win. And a bonus too.\n\nKid gets to learn about reproduction in a sterile yet immersive environment. And loss.\n\nDad gets a new computer and has a lot of fun building it.\n\nKid has a new, semi self assembled computer roughly one generation behind his father's.\n\nAnd the pika-computer is sentient enough to love the kid.\n\nBrb, gonna crowdfund  this blockbuster feel good film of the year.\n\n\nEDIT: finished story is on my page, I couldn't link no sleep here. And it might only be chapter one.... LolololololHawaii or Guam for sure.Yes, fucking AlaskaSure, if they don't want to build their own PC.  They can just buy a console, the option will be there.\n\nAll i'm saying is, you are really underestimating the value in empowering retail buyers to be able to build their own desktop at a store in person.  The convenience is there.Good luck fellow autist \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4cAnd by exercising his option to buy more sharesI'm really unrealistically hoping he would drop something like this on Monday to drive pressure on Tuesday. This is a wet dream though and I'm retarded.That\u2019s actually what I believe is the most realistic. Look for a form4 filing.Lol can't wait until gamestop offers me $2 for it like my used games> if they become a reliable source for used pc parts they will change the game\n\ngosh that would be so nice, and to be able to like inspect it in store as well, have had issues with used/refurbished parts being complete duds and having go through the whole tedious replace/return is awfulFucking lol, what the fuck did I just read.Oh oh yeah; totally. \nIt\u2019s a great idea. \nI think there\u2019s a market for sure.Drop it tuesday morning @9:30.

Other Information\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#1 Targeted Ads***\n\nAds and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.\n\nAds are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.\n\nTo me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**\n\nAdditionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#2 Shilling PLTR***\n\nI myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.\n\nShillery is OK, but at least give the facts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***\n\nIf you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's \"bad\" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.\n\n**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nI would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.\n\n*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.\n\n* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \\~260 million.***\n* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \\~987 million.***\n\nADDITIONALLY...\n\nPLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \\~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***\n\nPLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.\n\nHere's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:\n\n1. CDC\n2. Office of the Secretary\n3. Food and Drug Administration\n4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE\n5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS\n6. National Institute on Drug Abuse\n7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground\n8. Coast Guard / DHS\n9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command\n10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ\n11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS\n\nBoys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.\n\n***UPCOMING EARNINGS***\n\nI've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.\n\n***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nNow, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.\n\nI've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.\n\n***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nSome people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)\n\nIn my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.\n\nThere is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.\n\n***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***\n\nShort answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395\n\nPalantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.\n\nMithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.\n\nProspectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\nI suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.\n\n**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***\n\nFirst of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.\n\nIf you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.\n\nWhether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.\n\nNothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.\n\nPLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***\n\nTo my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:\n\n* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.\n* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.\n\nThere's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \\~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.\n\nWhen those shares are \"unlocked\" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.\n\n>According to [Palantir\u2019s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.\n\nWhat **WILL** affect stock price:\n\n* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.\n* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.\n\n*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*\n\nWhat **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:\n\n* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.\n* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)\n* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.\n* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.\n* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***\n\nImagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.\n\nPalantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.\n\nIt's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.\n\nLiterally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.\n\nWhile this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.\n\ntldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.\n\n**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**\n\nGovernments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.\n\nGovernments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.\n\n**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.\n\nPLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#8 Other Information***\n\n***\\*\\*Big known PLTR Holders\\*\\****\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a404oalxrob61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2dbcfac5a7ca207127771ec4e3133f8d943359\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR's Price List (2019)\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186](https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Personal TA and Crayon Mania\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR stock pumping events\\*\\****\n\n* 7'th Jan - Interview\n* 26'th Jan - Demonstration\n* 11'th Feb - Earnings\n* \\~15'th Feb - DPO expiration - Havoc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Similar Companies\\*\\****\n\n* PLTR - Palantir - Stock Price \\~$25 - Market Cap 48bln\n* AYX - Alteryx - Stock Price \\~$125 - Market Cap 8bln\n* Semantic Research - Private\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Known Contract Info\\*\\****\n\n* 240 million Palantir Air Force contract expiring soon in 3 months.

I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.\n\nAlso yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.\n\nI've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.\n\nI come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.\n\nMy PT's for PLTR are:\n\n* 48-89 by March or April.\n* 75 - 125 by EOY.\n* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0k1ujprob61.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3a16265edafa290432e6b79f9009e3df99f495", "score": 2195, "comment": "all jokes aside, i did try to read this and it was really informative. thanks for sharing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80I \nAM NOT\nTHROWING AWAY\nMY CALLSI\u2019ve used platanir in the marine school house and that shit was scary good at presenting data in a clear understandable way. No way the government would stop using their system unless someone comes with a better data aggregation. \u201cFirst mover advantage\u201d with the government helps since bureaucracy hates massive change so as long as they continue to integrate with the government systems they locked their future to a certain extentThank you for the time you put into this, this is the content I come here for.  I'm excited to see how this and clean energy ETFs do over the next year Also, \ud83d\ude80.I read the vanity fair article that claims PLTR uses a lot of data anayalst who does the gritty nitty work of extracting the data for it to make sense and its not a lot of automation involved. Can we see if that is true by looking at an expense line? Basically what they are claiming is that as the data sets get bigger and more complex, PLTR is actually losing more money because they require more and more manpower and salary.I can read, and this is great DD. Thanks palWell. This was amazingI don\u2019t understand, can you explain in \ud83d\ude80This was a great DD to start my weekend with, thank you. Bought in at $9.70 because Palantir will eventually be like the pre-cogs in Minority Report or project insight from Captain America Winter Soldier.So to summarize:\n\nP - push off \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\nL - lift off \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\nT - take off \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\nR - rise \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\"I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that  every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million  dollars. \"\n\nR&D expenses are a positive thing. Especially in a tech company. Napkin math time, you say normally 80m a quarter but 300m this time (so 540m tot) their current mkt cap is ~~1.9B~~  44.8 Billion so their PRR is ~~3.5~~. 95. (PRR = MktCap/R&D exp) The lower the PRR the better. Generally 5 - 10 is the sweet spot, so ~~3.5~~ 95 is a ~~growth indicator~~ not enough into R&D, which would explain the increase in the last quarter. \n\nAlso, interestingly Discovery Capital Management has their fingers in it. Robert Citrone co-founded that Hedge Fund and is also the largest minority owner of the Steelers. Makes me wonder if PLTR has thought about licensing their software to the NFL (Think Moneyball guys).\n\nJust some thoughts and opinions. Good DD guy.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nu/spreadsTrader pointed out my screw up with the math, corrections are in the strike outs.Read everything and felt like selling. Wtf? \ud83c\udf11I have friends who work in fed govt, one thing I know unless there is a major screw up they always renew contracts and increase budget by set percentage to adjust inflation every year. That's not just for pltr, its for every god damn thing. Once there is an expense entry in their books, its never going away.\n\nAs to future prospects, pltr got a good footholding because of covid tracing in lot of countries and this will only increase and provide chance to cross sell, up sell.\nThis is an investment stock, not a trading stock.\nPosition: 200 stocks @9.80, not selling for next few years.29/1 $27.5 C loadedGreat DD.   Glad you didn\u2019t mention moon or post any rocket emojisI just wanted to add that despite all these hit pieces and downgrades, the short interest in pltr remains fairly low. If institutions are so bearish on pltr, why don\u2019t they short it? That\u2019s because they are waiting for lockup to expire so they can get cheap shares and they are trying to keep the price down before that.\nAlmost forgot: palantir to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLink: https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4396504-palantir-shorts-are-missingGod, I wish I could read!I love it but would like to add a few things that no one seems to ever mention which I feel is huge. Sandwiched in the investor presentation Palantir mentioned...\n\nThe federal government has a law that they cannot stop use of an entity or service that is to their benefit, to try and create something of their own.\n\nMeaning unless someone else comes along and does Palantir better than Palantir, the government by law cannot replace Palantir. They have to stay with them because it provides them a benefit. Palantir SUED the government for this, and won.\n\nIn my eyes all of the R&D expense is no different than Amazon or Tesla reinvesting in building their foundation.\n\nThis is huge and in my eyes pretty much locks Palantir in to the government. The real combo breaker will be if they can create a new product with a low overhead and lower price point, that can appeal to the masses. Like the Model 3.Thanks for the work mate.\nIn my opinion you have the choice between these options:\n1. Buy under 25 dollar\n2. Wait and buy after the earnings and the Soros storyDiners, Drive-ins and Dives? I\u2019m in.Dude are u manic?Thank you! I tried explaining to my wife\u2019s boyfriend but he wouldn\u2019t read\n\n\ud83d\ude80Great post. Short term, could it be good to sell some before 15th Feb then buy back after?Thank you.  Learned a little I didn\u2019t already know.   My question is- if you are this confident, why not get the Jan\u201923 $50 calls?  They will DRAMATICALLY outperform the sharesThis was really well thought out and good DD. I also strongly believe that Q1 earnings will surprise to the upside and will act as the first real catalyst for the stock. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the rise of domestic terrorism further fueling the govt's need for the types of data analytics PLTR specializes in.i like your words magic man, im in, ive always been in2/19 27c checking in I bought at open yesterday down 20 percent already how we lookingupvote for the great Revolut screenshot! and a shitload of money thereYou son of a bitch, I'm inNot enough  \ud83d\ude80 . \n\n1650 shares checking in.This was a detailed and informative read. Thank you for writing it up. These are the best types of posts in this subreddit.Great post thank you so much. I Hate myself for selling my pltr leaps a few weeks ago, but want to get back in and just diamond hand it. \n\nThoughts on calls exp Jan 20 2023 $45c??Zero chance I'm reading any of that.Thanks for sharing. I\u2019m a newer investor. I\u2019ve spent most of my time in ETFs and Index funds. \n\nI think the long term aspects of PLTR look good. Short term is questionable depending on lockout. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell from\nmy full fledged retarded view. \n\nI bought 2.5K worth of PLTR stock this past Friday after hearing about it on this sub. Looking at available info on the google machine, I thought it was a good risk as the company is projected to start turning a profit and the lockout and earnings date will hold the price down. Once the lockout/earnings report plays out I think this stock has nowhere to go but up. Too many upsides. You have proven people, expanding niche market that has the chance to go big time tech. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell.\n\nThis is my view as a full fledged autist of course. I hope to have \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c in the long term. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80200USD is snowflake like valuation.\n\nDoable, sure. Unlikely.

Miss the long winded DD posts. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Thanks man, good DD. Have about 300 shares @ about 13. Will \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udd90 and add to them for years, for the reasons you\u2019ve stated. \n\nAlso, PLTR has stated that their mission is, in essence, to support Western ideals and democracies; they won\u2019t do business, e.g., with China. \n\nI wonder if that plays a role in the fearmongering about this great company (eg, if you\u2019re support PLTR, you\u2019re a racist/fascist/etc.)Great write up. Reading about PLTR's a rabbit hole kinda deal, I love it. To the moon  \ud83d\ude80Great read thanks.bought PLTR calls yesterday at the top. lets fucking go bois I AM NOT THROWING AWAY MY CALLSYou are missing intelligence community as a customer.  Im sure there are deals that cannot be reported in the books.Other similar companies:  \nIBM 114bn\n\nDatabricks 6bn\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLTR by your EOY estimation has the same market value as IBM or higher. Over 10 times higher maketcap than more similar companies like Databricks(arguably waaaaay more successful, not IPO'd yet).This is great great DD. My one question is how does the dual class stock play into stock valuation when common shareholders basically have no voting rights? I\u2019m all in on Palantir, but this is literally my only concern.!RemindMe! 1 monthI'm in on PLTR and I think I'll up my stake next week. This company can only grow, with Thiel and Karp as founders/directors that is a green light to invest. \n\nQuestion on Revolut: what's your experience on their service and can you trade options?100% appreciate this, I\u2019m a small bag holder on PLTR. Unbiased advice here with both a good upside and some cons.You fucking legend. Thank you so much for this great effort!Give TLDR. Can't read.wow towards the end when OP says losing sleep over it, going full schizzo after going all in; felt that. im not all in, i have a regular position for my port but i hope youre right cadetYou\u2019re explanation of what $PLTR can do for clients made me think of Jack Bauer in 24. If that show taught us anything it\u2019s that CTU can\u2019t lose. So in short, $PLTR is Jack Bauer. This means I\u2019m buying more $PLTR. Thank you for the research and your take on it all. And thanks in advance for the trip to Mars! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Excellent DD. Thank you for sharing that.\n\nThe market is searching for validation to buy. At large corporations, funds, etc., individuals and teams don\u2019t want to make moves with the risk of being considered a moron and getting fired. Buying into PLTR as an institution right now could label you a moron if analysts from big research houses like Citi are right and it goes to $15-20. Then you\u2019re the guy/gal or desk who bought PLTR for your fund / pension / whatever when everyone was calling PT at $15 and it went to $15.\n\nRight now we have company employees and ownership (locked up), hedge funds, early investors and retail investors in. Then you have the idiots who think the real PT is $15 pushing it down.\n\nSo, the kind of buyers that make prices move big time are not in yet. If they were the stock would be well over $50. We need earnings to validate that move. Everything you said about the one-time compensation expenses is spot on. I see R&D as bullish - when companies have massive market opportunity, R&D goes up. Leadership is excellent.\n\nDisclaimer: currently sitting on a 143.52% return already because I bought in the day of the direct listing. Avg cost $10.64.Pump it upAwesome effort. I\u2019m holding my PLTR for the long term and buying the dips anyway but its nice to see someone put this effort in. Not expecting it to hit Saturn but reckon it will be a great long term optionAre Shares or leaps the play here?Good DD but I don't know. With the CC's I've been selling I've reduced my cost basis to around $15.70 on 5,500 shares. I'd like to see this thing at least touch all time highs again before I decide to sell out. I believe in the company but this is off to a rough start with wallstreets vendetta against it. Lots of other great plays happening around me but my money has been tied up in sideways action now for months. We'll see what happens after lockup before I decide how long I'm going to hold.Thanks for the thoughtful post. Your time and effort are appreciated.\n\nI have mixed feelings on Alteryx being called a direct competitor. \nAlteryx helps analysts put different data sources together more easily but they are still on their own when creating insights. It seems like PLTR does the technical implementation so analysts can focus on the analysis 100%.\n\nIt might just be nuance for some, but to me that is the sole differentiator and what makes PLTR unique. *Thoughts?*\n\nI have a similar horizon of ~1yr and I'm long shares and leaps.Upvote for explaining how the governments work. I work for local government in the UK and they can barely create an internal HR system to view and book holiday on.\nWhen they do create stuff it takes an age and all the decision makers are dusty old boomers in ill fitting suits from the 80s.\nPLTR can do exactly what they want in 1/10 of the time and 10x better - they have a massive market to capitalise on.\nI\u2019ve been slowly moving my portfolio over to PLTR since Christmas. I think it\u2019s now time to go balls deep \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Good analysis, thanks. I am a former investment banker and current private equity investor.

Well already holding a position but now im going all in \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80a fellow revolut usercan this be the PLTR equivalent of u/deepf\\*invalue?Thank you for the DDThere's a super in depth DD of PLTR on Seeking Alpha titled \"Palantir: Parallels With Microsoft, Potential Network Effects Underappreciated\" that I would recommend if you're all in. I didn't paste the link because i think SA links are banned here. Has a price target of $47 by 2022.\n\nI've been a screeching PLTR fanboy since a bit before the first public earnings report and I agree that this company is still undervalued in comparison to other SaaS and data management/analytics companies. However, I do think that the increasing politicization of PLTR should not be ignored given PLTR's dedication to serving the US and the current state of US politics. AOC has criticized PLTR for it's contracts with ICE and the unfortunate consequences of the insights PLTR provided to ICE agents. It's often discussed here that Obama and Joe like surveillance which PLTR allegedly assists with and can/does face criticism from representatives from both parties who are more privacy-focused. \n\nThese things are more of a testament to how good their software is than anything, but it's clear now more than ever that other business (potential clients) have no problem disassociating themselves from highly politicized firms so that they don't end up in the spotlight as well. To be honest, I hope that PLTR makes Foundry a separate company that is still owned by PLTR (think Alphabet vs Google) so that their political work doesn't affect their commercial brand.\n\nTLDR: PLTR \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ugh. Another post by someone who has been on Reddit for less than a year. Why would I believe this. Also, literally the only thing this account posts about if PLTR.We can't of course not really evaluate the connection to trump. Thats another factor why you can't accurately predict howfundamentally this company will do in this year.   \ne their products, because they aren't available to public and nobody really knows how they work (at least i didn't find something) (which is also resulting in an outcry from rightwatch groups for months)   \nagencies\n\nAlso, it looks like they profited hugely because of trump. Alex Karp is somehow connected to trump, even before his presidency even begun. I think it aint a coincidence that PLTR grows if the government pushes them.   \n\n\nBefore trump PLTR also lost contracts with NSA for example. They have a good or bad product but not everyone is satisfied and i find it hard to really evaluate their products, because they aren't available to public and nobody really knows how they work (at least i didn't find something) (which is also resulting in an outcry from civil-right-watch groups for months)   \nagencies\n\nOf course, Biden won't push PLTR away if it does work. But it does seem like a huge gamble to me. If the contracts don't get a renewal, then this company is in serious trouble.  \n\n\nWe can't of course not really evaluate the connection to trump. Thats another factor why you can't accurately predict how fundamentally this company will do in this year.   \n\n\nWe don't know how much trumps connection with Alex did something and how much force there was for the agencies to use PLTR instead of another competitor it could be that under Biden this pressure, if it was necessary isn't existing anymore and then you are will see all these contracts expiring and the company isn't yet profitable?  \n\n\n**Don't get me wrong:** It seems like a nice stock, but a one with heavy gambling. Or i got something fundamentally wrong and can't read us-balance-sheetsVery in depth and valuable information here. Thank you. More posts like this on this sub!!TLDR; motherfucker do you speak it?!I have come a across of pltr as part of my day job. What they sell is a bitemporal data built on a sql database. That is what pltr sells and honestly that is not a difficult problem to solve. They managed to win  govt contracts because of Peter theil's connections with trump. They literally given up on their product for financial institutions because the clients figured out that pltr adds no value. Best of luck pumping a low margin IT consultancy business.The hero we needed>PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks.

They themselves have said that their software was made 5 years before the world needed it, meaning it will take time for it to ingratiate into all major corporations that need such data analysis.\nMy only concern is the lockup expiry as I have a lot of shares and may have to think of a trailing stop limit sell so I can buy back more shares if the price drops.PLTR \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Insane PTs.

Its too well done with all the right language for WSB written in .Ummmm isn't earning reports of the 15th though of MarchI read every word and I could not agree more! The research is spot on. I've worked with DoD in war zones, and I've researched PLTR extensively. What PLTR does is priceless! It removes countless dumb contractors which cost billions!

Thanks for taking the time to post all of this, great info.Why do you say they track OIL?Similar companies Alteryx?? wut:rocket:did you mention the part where the new director of national intel, Avril Haines consulted for PLTR? I would think that she knows the software much better than those dumb feks from the CDC and would advise Biden to give them the finger.Every large companies that have trust, safety, and fraud department will be a Palantir customer. Facebook, Paypal, Intuit, Allianz are few knowns one and this list will only keep growing.wow high quality DD here, thanks mateI'm 490 shares deep! To the moon brother!Great DD, it aggregates all the public info on PLTR quite well. \n\nAlthough, I think an increase in R&D cost is a good thing for companies that are supposedly growing. Especially for a company who is currently trading at around ~40x P/E. \n\nAlso, can you elaborate on why you think PT will be 50+ by April and 100+ next year? They would need to significantly increase their earnings or they'd be around SNOW levels of overvaluation (100+x P/E).Duck me I\u2019m not reading thatWow. I\u2019m a small pot of \u00a31k in at $26 and you are $250k. I hope we are both right!I'm holding PLTR too. How big realistically do you think their market cap could go? 48 Billion already at a stock price around $25, is it going to be a trillion dollar company? If so how?  \n\nAlso  \ud83d\ude80\"I come from it so I know\"\n\nBlah blah blah who gives a fuck. There's millions of you. \n\n\nPT by eoy north of 100 is severely stupid. You think this is a 200B company as it stands? NoThis fucking retard has $250k of PLTR on Revolut.

Why does that matter because of cost of delivery. They\u2019re a bespoke packaged software house.\n\n * Each software solution they sale must be customized and professional services involved. In essence they are a consultancy.\n\nWhy this matter _against_ the bull thesis? Because they won\u2019t be able to grow at the multiple at which it stands. The multiple it\u2019s currently enjoying is hype, mono, etc. but unlike other software companies they won\u2019t be able to grow at the clip the shares are priced at.\n\nIn your comparison, you compare it to Alteryx, and plantir has a 6X larger market cap with only a small fraction of the revenues.\n\nTL;DR: incomplete analysis leads to errors in conclusion.TL;DR; PltR $30 bY 12/31 oR I eAT mY LeFt TeSTicLe LiVe ON tWiTCh!\n\nYeah I'm still bitter.

Sure the company seems great but the financials just do not back the current value. \n\nI wish you autists the best and hope it works out for ya but it doesn't make any sense to me. How can $BB not be extremely undervalued in cybersecuruty with $PLTR at it's current price?Wow this is incredible. We all owe this man a debt of gratitude.So what you\u2019re saying is my 1/22 28c are doomed.Sorry bro. We first take on GME, then we can go after PLTR. We are at war right now and all money just be redirected to GME frontline#7 I would blow my GFs lover for that ability at my work.You have just convinced me to short PLTR around earnings time.#9. More gains in GME.A classic case of enough biased words makes a bad position seem plausible.\n\nFunny thing is, I was toying with the idea of doing DD on PLTR for a post this weekend titled \"PLTR doesn't love you anymore and hasn't since Thanksgiving\".  But then I decided I'd rather go snowmobiling.\n\nThe short reply to your novel here is that they're trading at too high a multiplier relative to their peers, the incoming administration is going to take money from government arms that would use PLTR and reallocate it in their quest to send our tax dollars to other nations so those nations can get free solar powered roads and bird guillotines, their balance sheet is a bit of a mess, and they've got too much activist investor attention.  Oh, and they're too reliant on a client (the government) which is slow on contracts and about to inflate our dollars to worthlessness, which devalues the contracts, but won't be able to make up for that elsewhere\n\nSources not provided because I'm a lazy fuck who doesn't love you, either.\n\nTL:DR: PLTR gang is just 2021 version of MU gang: so caught up on why it should be \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and who are going to spend years screaming about how it doesn't make sense why it's not happening.If the likes of Google and Facebook don't need it because they can develop their own, why does the US government need it? They love to hire contractors to build their own unique systems as opposed to buying a COTS solution like PLTR.Ban for trying to get us to read all of thatCongratulations on not mentioning Biden or Russia one time.  \n\nPalantir is about to get relegated to the dustbin of history.  They have no moat.  They have no contracts.  These dudes are just cutting an enormous paycheck at your expense.\n\nThis is a murky investment and it won\u2019t get any clearer because that would only bring the stock down.  Some insider is going to buy a few million shares and you are going to just shit yourself with excitement.\n\nThe flat out truth is not only is Palantir garbage, but it\u2019s easier to make your money elsewhere in the market.  Short term it\u2019s lost its appeal.  And it\u2019s *definitely* easier to make long money than parking it in this retarded investment.I also tried to read it.

MAD RESPECTI'm young scrappy and hungryEyyyy mah man :)RISE UPWhat clean energy ETF are we buying???I think people also forget that the ancillary purpose of government contracting @ DoD is to fund the next generation of tech during the valley between \"innovative new idea\" and \"broadly viable on the commercial market\".  For new tech, the value of those government contracts is gargantuan. If PLTR figures their shit out (which is *the* bet, IMO) and becomes huge in corporate america...5 or 10 years out, 25 dollars/share will seem insanely undervalued.**platanir**Companies like Palantir are pros at digging their claws into companies.  It's gets to the point where they'll be so ingrained no one will even know how to get them out.Capitalize that M killer.There are plenty of good competitors in that space -\\_-Which clean energy ETFs are you looking at besides ICLN and TAN?>Thank you for the time you put into this, this is the content I come here for.  I'm excited to see how this and clean energy ETFs do over the next year Also, \ud83d\ude80.\n\nI like QCLN.I would like an answer to this as well.They released a software that reduces the installation time by half and manpower needed to go on location as well. Over time when they have enough data on certain sectors they can probably cut off sending the manpower completely. The reason they have to send ao many engineers is that they customise it to the clients needs. The engineers therefore are actually learning the workflow of the company over months and catering custom functions. \n\nSay once the company knows the ins and outs of a huge airline company then they can more or less reduce the installation time on their next airline client and send out lesser amount of engineers. In the long run this can be seen as gathering field data to build their own efficiency so the money they spend on engineers out is actually research for them>PLTR uses a lot of data anayalst who does the gritty nitty work of extracting the data\n\nWelcome to ANY data platform.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"AI\" that works out of the box.  You will always need data scientists for this sort of thing.\n\nThere is likely economy of scale here tho, the more data sets the more common functions you can build.  I.e. find a data source in one gov org that exists in another then you only build the model once, find that again in another 5 agencies and you simply redeploy the model, made adaptations to one, and it applies to them all.  It's all about the data.\n\nWhether or not they're losing money on data scientists is a different discussion.  I find this hard to believe, maybe a loss leader for some clients, but as someone who sells data platforms, consulting, and integration, you just add margin to resource cost or blend it with software/services.A quick scan of their Q3 2020 income statement backs the claim that they are spending a lot more on R&D expenses and just operating expense in general as they are growing.\n\nAbout a 13% increase in revenue from the prior quarter. I didn't compare their actual Q2 revenue, I just divided their revenue as of Sept 2020 by 3 to estimate a Q2 revenue number.\n\nQ3 2020: R&D is 108% of revenue\n\nYTD 2020: R&D is 61% of revenue\n\nTotal Operating Expenses for Q3 2020 is 341% of revenue\n\nTotal Operating Expenses YTD 2020 is 195% of revenue\n\nIt's not abnormal for a company to spend more on operations as they grow but these are numbers that I would want to consider.\n\nWas trying to find a breakdown of their operating expenses but didn't find one.You could go look at their income statement, and see if their are any notes attached re: their wage expense. Also maybe correlate years of higher expenses with contracts signed with more complex customers?From what I understand, Pltr licenses the software, and the AI aggregates and presents huge swaths of company data in a tangible manner in which our human brains can understand. The AI scales itself with data, and in the process human capital more efficient, which saves companies crap tons of money and manpower, the value in doing that makes pltr money. Pltr develops the AI with engineers and data analysts/scientists.This is true and a significant threat to how they scale (not very well). It takes data science experts and domain experts to partner with these companies data to tailor make these experiences. Its basically like IBM Watson in that regard.\n\nThese knowledge engines aren't magic, and all voodoo AI or something. Palantir has been hemorraging money in operating expenses largely due to the nature of how they are setup (you think they'd have gone public if things were peachy in their shadow ops with the gov?)\n\nFurther, there is a major risk of impact due to data regulation with the companies they partner with.\n\nFrom their own website on GDPR:\n\"Foundry\u2019s flexible data protection capabilities are helping organizations prepare for an ever-evolving global regulatory environment, from the GDPR to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and beyond.\"\nhttps://www.palantir.com/solutions/gdpr/\n\nAnd beyond is a key phrase here. More is coming, and they regularly acknowledge this.\n\nParticularly after the last year, and violent extremists on social media platforms. Big data companies that have been ruthlessly exploiting the public data will feel the pain with a Democrat controlled congress and this has bipartisan support regardless.\n\nThe downstream of that will impact analytics companies like PLTR. They probably won't be crushed by this alone but any opportunities it presents are far outweighed by the risks.\n\nThis is a major reason they've been desperately trying to diversify into other areas, but its largely small potatoes when most of their revenue still comes from the feds. Their software is not cheap, so if youre not getting the ROI... bye! (I.e. post-covid)\n\nGoogle and FB are currently in the cross hairs for antitrust, but its inevitable data regulation will continue to be a major threat to large tech.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake.\n\n\"We strive to contextualize major world problems and think critically about whether it's possible to engineer complementary solutions in an ethically responsible way. When the answer is no, we turn the opportunity down.\" https://www.palantir.com/pcl/\n\nWhen the answer is \"no\". Yep, totally ethical and cool. \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo if the answer is kill the terrorist along with 10 children or the bus driver with 20 children and 2 terrorists, based on some twitter/FB/insta data and correlating that with those hacked emails/comms/dragnet collection from the nation state government theyre partnering with is the answer for them \"no\" or... hmm let's talk with your experts and figure out the details. And what made this person a terrorist? Who defines the label? He was a MAGA terrorist! No he was an Antifa terrorist!\n\nI'm sure there's no grey areas when dealing with ICE or Afghanistan/other Middle Eastern countries, or the police forces of America which are also super ethical, right? \n\nFWIW I am absolutely biased against them if that hasn't been made clear. I have vehemently disliked them since 2014 and will shit on them whenever the chance arises. I don't support companies that are effectively super powering the dragnet collection against entire populations of people with 0 transparency or oversight and abetting companies/governments in committing human rights violations. I suspect many others share a similar sentiment with me.\n\nTl;dr Best of luck to you that are on this FOMO \ud83d\ude80> gritty nittyI guess you could take a look at their open positions (what kind of profiles they're looking to fill in their payroll). You would expect to see a lot of Data Science / AI profiles, and some  senior ones in order to develop those automation algorithms.That sounds like a really shitty process.In their investment day videos they said their rollout costs have greatly reduced and they are able to set up their software much quicker than they used to. \n\nI guess it will always take a bit of work as it will be custom for each company, but it looks like one of their goals is to significantly reduce that cost, and they are succeeding in that. They do the whole rollout for free, which is a huge plus for potential customers.There is no fucking way they have people going through most of the dataRight, same here. Red flags when determine purchase is if they add some kind of dedicated support really cheap, which to me means, \"you can't use this product we will use it for you\".Every sentence just looked like this to me.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80PLTR \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Thiel \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I AM NOT THROWING AWAY MY CALLS \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I scrolled all the way down and this was the first \ud83d\ude80 I saw.

If R&D was not increasing, then I would be concerned because that means they have nothing new to sell to the market. \n\nDon\u2019t read Barron\u2019s, don\u2019t read seeking alpha, etc. do some independent thinking.They are, i'm just worried because i don't know what would cause you to have to increase R&D costs by 150-350 million dollars EXTRA per year compounding. I wish Karp would put my head to rest on this somehow.\n\nI hope it's real R&D cost and not money spent on a non optimized process that will simply bloat and grow forever...>) their current mkt cap is 1.9B so their PRR is 3.5. (PRR = MktCap/R&D exp) \n\numm, why did you use 1.9B when it's 44.67BPeople would rather see 1000 bad sales guys with a 3 month average turnover than good R&D that will give the 10 big hitters the ability to close dealsI too felt a large discrepancy between the overall read and the 10x in 1 year price target lolThis. I'm glad I'm not the only one. A lot more negative potential than positive potential in the short run and maybe long run. Sure, the one time cost of listing and compensation was only for last quarter, but where is the growth coming from? He stated ~500mil growth needs to be maintained to break even in the upcoming years. Will the US government allow PLTR to sell to other countries? If this Tech is our advantage, why would we allow them to sell to other countries?\n\nThe dilemma would be PLTR hooking up with another Govs. We would threaten to pull out and use another company. It all comes down to if it's worth it for PLTR to lose the US contracts for outside growth. Let's play chicken. Who has the power in this scenario. I'm too retarded to understand the psyche on this and the maths on the opportunity cost for both parties. Anyways,\n\n5 PLTR 35c Jan 21 '22\n5 PLTR 26.5c Feb 12 '21I sold last week to lock in some profit; the resistance to $30 pricing and the dpo unlock has me a little shook. I anticipate a dip after the unlock at which point I am going to be buying back in for loooong holds.welp buying puts now.The military don\u2019t typically like to change vendors especially if the agencies have been using their tech for years. They\u2019ll just keep giving money for upgrades/renewals. Palantir is set for decades with gov\u2019t contracts alone.\n\nFor growth, investors just want to see if they are able to scale in the commercial side because that\u2019s where the money is.\n\nNow they\u2019re public, people will know more what they do so I think Palantir is just getting started.Yea, if it's not getting axed after the pilot phase it's not getting axed ever.30 contracts deep $35c 2/19.\n\nedit: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80The politically motivated hit pieces are the funniest.

Big techs can't for political reasons. Your grievance is valid, but wait until you live under China boots, and you will beg for something like PLTR to protect your freedom.The oversight comes with the end user, not Palantir.  When SOF does mission planning and execution, they are held responsible.  Palantir just makes it more effective, enhancing planning and saving lives.Hard finding thinking against the meme around here. Thank you for that.Palantir doesn't directly handle any of their customers data. They just set it up in a way that makes it much easier to process for the customer themselves.I disagree with your assessment of their role in prosecuting terrorists, but other comments have addressed this.\n\nRegarding the regulatory environment, I actually see this as a pro.  I work at one of the major software companies.  PLTR\u2019s data tagging, access model and data source transparency remind me of the GDPR modernization we went through a few years ago, but better implemented.  PLTR\u2019s software is capable of automatically tagging and associating various data fragments as a single customer, and if that customer requests all data a company has on them or asks for that data to be deleted (as are core responsibilities of companies under GDPR), having such a unified view is a huge advantage in enforcing these regulatory mandates.I briefly dated one of their senior SWEs a few yrs ago. Suffice it to say, the stories I heard about their business dealings turned my stomach. Fuck PLTR. There are tendies to be made elsewhere.This is the way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80<3\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80Yeah totally.\n\nA golden rule for startups: \"If you're making profit, you aren't growing fast enough\"\n\nIn a disruptive tech startup, high R&D spending is bullish as fuck if it's backed by increasing sales.  PLTR looks strong as fuck for the long-term.This.  Take whatever Barrons and Seeking Alpha is saying and inverse them.  The fact is that they are paid shills.  People only pay shills when it benefits them and makes them profit.  The market being an oppositional establishment in nature, means you generally do the *opposite* of what paid shills tell you to do.this. A lot of these Authors are just trying to get you to subscribe to their service or get views. they go from one stock to the next. they have no skin in the game. it's no different than Shannon Sharpe criticizing a basketball player, a sport he has no expertise in. he is paid to give a strong opinion and create buzz and generate views and clicks. always do your own DD and use everything else as supplemental info.You are out of your mind if you think this will be 200+ any time soon.  That would put it valued atca market cap of around 300 billion.  That is just silly.You gotta spend money to make money.I used to work in R&D. Burning money produces real world data, and data is valuable. It\u2019s a good sign when those costs go up. \n\nIn palantir\u2019s case, they have defense contracts. If those costs go up, that means they are producing results, and the clients are further pushing for growth and progress on previous projects to be continued. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16Shit. good catch, just woke up. Had plugged number of shares instead of cap. that changes thingsI was wondering the same thing..The amount of money the founders make, and the fact that the one guy hired his wife straight into the company scare the shit out of me.I used to work for a competitor and we killed a deal with Gyna not because of foreign government concerns per se, but because we were all but certain they would just rip off our IP. The competitor I worked for sells to basically anyone though. Law enforcement throughout the world, US govt and LE agencies, private law firms and accounting firms, etc.Read a few articles weeks ago, they seem to already have been partnering with other governments recently, greece's covid response plan, Japan/Fujitsu contracts, but I'm just as retarded as everyone else on here... 120 PLTR shares @ 26.14They land contracts with other govt too. Last time I remember it was GreeceThis is not the way.This is the way.\n\ud83d\ude80Same but 33c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80The stratosphere is very flavorfulThat\u2019s gangsterSo my Investment Strategy is based on herd mentality inspired by manics and maniacs. Nice.You think it'll go down towards earnings then up after then?\n\nSaw some posts on PCG a month or so back, may re-read and have a look myself\n\nCongrats on the GME tendies!I\u2019ll answer: it\u2019s because share lockup ends in Feb. and previously unsellable shares will hit the market. \n\nRemember me when you hit a mill and buy me a used Kia.I\u2019ll try to help.  LEAPs both make millionaires and destroy wealth.   The far OTM calls are often called LEAPs.  (Look it up).  The Jan\u201923 $50 Calls are about $7-9 a piece (amplified by 100).  One call = $700-900 to buy.\n\nThey are $50 strike in my example.  They are \u201cOTM\u201d out of the money, very far out of the money in fact because PPS is only $25 right now.\nLets say you pay $9.  By the expiration date in Jan 2023 you need the share price to be a MINIMUM of $59 just to break even- because the calls will be worth approximately their intrinsic value on expiration day.  \n\nFor every amount over $50 on the day of expiration the contract value will grow.\n\nIf the PPS is $75 on day of expiration the contract will be worth $25.  You paid $9.  You made almost 3x.   Meanwhile if you bought shares today for comparison you\u2019d make about 3x (75 / 25 = 3x)...  around $75 PPS the share and calls perform similarly...\n\nNOW let\u2019s say he is right (he\u2019s not, it\u2019s overzealous but only by a little...) and the share price is well into the $100\u2019s; let\u2019s say $150.\nIf he bought shares today that\u2019s a 6x gain.... but if he bought the Jan\u201923 contracts they\u2019ll be worth approximately $100 per contract ($150-50 = $100 intrinsic value on day of expiration). He only paid $9 per contract.  So that\u2019s an 11x on calls versus the \u201cmere\u201d 6x.\n\nAnd this is all using the day of expiration and intrinsic value only as examples.  The calls can outperform the shares much faster due to inefficiencies, liquidity, and \u201cGreeks\u201d.\n\nWhen you see some of the market made millionaires they\u2019re often because of LEAPs- far OTM calls on high conviction plays.\n\nI think PLTR will be $60-80 by EOY \u201821 and $120-160 by EOY \u201822 potentially with some wild fluctuations along the way.  I think the revenue and profitability will surge and WS will cave after 1-4 more blowout earnings and start rating it appropriately.  For this reason it is also essentially my all-in as well with about $550k including $200k worth of you guessed it- the Jan\u201923 $50 calls.Ok thanksStrike?Trying to be realistic. There\u2019s no short squeeze.Widely used. Partners with Azure and AWS.\n\nH&M, Zalando, Shell, Exxon, AstraZeneca, bp, T-Mobile....\n\nIn terms of government contracts they are probably on par with $PLTR.Databricks is a cloud computing PaaS.  It abstracts away having to work with AWS. Palantir is (like OP said) a glorified dashboarding platform.I get you ahahahaTo be fair, in what industry isn\u2019t there competition?\n\nThis is an extremely sticky space in terms of clientele. Once a contract has been landed, what incentives do governments and enterprises have to replace or build the solutions Palantir is offering themselves? I have a hard time believing the budget would be allocated.\n\nGiven that Palantir is ahead of the game in their product offering, having inroads into governments and enterprise customers could open up more sales opportunities down the line.\n\nSo then it comes down to what you believe the market opportunity isThere already is competition in this space. Like another poster said once Palantir gets its claws in you you're on the PLTR ride for the rest of your life.  This market is literally driven by boomer upper/middle managers who want to invest in \"data\" .  This worked for Tableau after their 2016 collapse.  Palantir is like Tableau but with a technical consulting wing and an already established base of government contracts.  \n\nMid-term they at worst move sideways. Long term it depends on future product lines.  I can easily see them challenging Salesforce's crusty ass CRM or acquiring a smaller \"data\" startup and bringing it into their offering.The premium I receive for selling the covered calls can mathematically be removed from my overall cost basis. You then re-divide that by the amount of shares you own and you get your adjusted cost basis.[removed]Yes. And I\u2019m drunk. Fuck her.Can't tell if retard or idiot \ud83e\udd14Yeah, reading this DD made me less excited to hang on to this stock. Been uneasy since1-that link to license costs is not broken - my mistake.\n\n2-Palantir has customers from a number of sectors. To identify oil only is w-r-o-n-g.What\u2019s a scare piece? I\u2019m a software engineer and have worked in software consultancies in my decade-plus career.Does BB not do private cybersecurity consulting work now? I was under the impression that they had segwayed into that market besides their suites.Nah. It's a solid company. I haven't spent as much time as OP on the fundamentals but I love the ethos of the company and I love Karp. I've watched a lot of interviews with him and read a fair amount about him. I've also read about the work environment and am convinced they will continue to attract the best talent.I know they blow but they still do it. I haven't seen them transition to wising up and using COTS software but I would like to see it.Really have my doubts about Cathie in 2021No I bought PLTR at 11 and sold at 27.  I get my kicks clowning bagholders.I'm just looking for the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80My pleasure! Thanks for alluding to it <3Apparently haha I hope it sticksWhy so far out?Looks like three to meThank you! I\u2019ve got some LIT and also BATT>CTEC\n\nThank you, did not know about this one! I'll check it out!That's cute, but you have 0 clue what you're talking about. If you're relying on Palantir to save you, you should lay off the drugs.\n\nUS Cyber Command and our intelligence apparatus are one of the most effective entities on the planet, and has no qualms about being unethical in the pursuit of their mission.\n\nAnd China is going to have an internal crisis on its hands before it ever overtakes the US. You think inequality is bad in the US? PRC doesn't have as much support as they'd want you to believe.So in other words, palantir does no oversight because its the responsibility of their customer? Which is exactly the opposite of what they state.\n\nWhile it would be nice to believe the rosy picture you paint, they aren't transparent. You can lie to yourself if that makes you feel better about your investment though.\n\nI strongly doubt they'll exist in 10 years but feel free to ride the meme wave or wherever people think this is going.Don't get me wrong, I think data processing and privacy regulation is big business in the future for some companies. I just don't think anyone will pay PLTR to do it, or will want to be associated with them outside of their tiny niche they've carved out.\n\nFrankly if you think their operations with the domestic or foreign military organizations are ethical, I got a bridge to sell you. They are facilitating the analysis of large scale dragnet collection of civilians of various middle eastern and Asian countries.\n\nAnd these operators I'm sure have a good track record of ethics and concern for human rights... or not.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/trump-afghanistan-airstrikes-increased-civilian-deaths-by-330-since-2016-2020-12\n\nNot that I give Obama a pass either.\n\nSnowflake /AWS /Salesforce and every other big data company will eventually eat their lunch with the continued AI innovations with unstructured/semi structured data will make their business model obsolete (they'll scramble to adapt and start hemmoraging all of their incredibly expensive talent).Username does NOT check out.Damn I just got in on PLTR this week, are they basically a shady CIA data company? What that ex-employee say, if you don't mind?This is the way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Palantir is 18 years old. Not saying they shouldn't be targeting growth but idk if Id call them a startupWith all that\u2019s happened with GME, you can see those fuckers writing hit pieces to help contain the price. It\u2019s so obvious. The wording they use is clearly to scare people - it\u2019s not fair or neutral at all. They are paid to say a certain thing. Motley fool, Barron\u2019s, seeking alpha - if they\u2019re so smart about investing why are they writing articles instead opening up a proprietary trading fund themselves? \n\nOh it\u2019s because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re soingZM market cap is currently over 110 billion, it was over 170 billion at some point last year. Their 2020 revenue is barely double of current PLTR revenue. Go figure\"You are out of your mind if you think GME will be over $15 and time soon\"\n\nI agree with you but I have learned in the last year nothing works how it used to and stock jumps do not happen because of fundamentals anymore.\n\nAnything can happen in the Matrix.\"you are out of your mind to think Tesla will be 100+ this year\"\n\nBlah blah blah, heard it all before. \ud83d\ude80I think it can be but it will need a couple more years for that.I\u2019m selling when he brings on his wife\u2019s boyfriend.It only scares you because you don't know this or worse is going on in literally every company this size.That guy's wife is a Stanford IT graduate though. So, it's not like she's just there for the paycheck.Someone\u2019s gotta make the coffeeYou think its not common in corporate life?They seem willing to work with anyone except the traditional enemies of the west.

Energy /utilities is a possible benefactor of a rotation. They have their fire insurance safety certificates now. They are looking at solar and batteries and are cheap af. Likely not a very exciting play but I bought in a $10 and I'm thinking about growing it now in the less retarded part of my holdings. GME was great I was glued to the sp for 3 days 7 bagger!Thank you so much for such an in depth response!

Usernames are like actual names. They don\u2019t matter.Palantir is Big Brother confirmedTo tech communities I've been in:\n - optimised for growth and change = startup\n - optimised for profit and stability = business\n\nPLTR seems somewhere in between the two now.  Still chasing growth pretty aggressively, but compromising with some profitability too.\n\nOn the other hand, there's often an extra condition for \"startup\" which is that it must be privately held, so I guess by my own usual metrics they aren't a startup any more.Find a successful stock. Build its timeline. Cross reference that with articles Motley Fool has written about the company. \n\nSee for yourself they have no fucking idea what they\u2019re talking about.Exactly, there are companies with market cap of 10x their revenue.You guys have been trying to pump PLTR for months, it's over.Yeah but it also scares me because I'm in 25k, rollin heavyAnd government... As seen in recent US politics.IT is IT, does it matter that it came from Stanford? Maybe. I just think nepotism is a terrible business model to haveThink about it, wife = $200k a year. Wife provides coffee, food, and blowjobs. Its easy to find an employee that will provide you with food and coffee, and its easy to find an employee that provides you with blowjobs, but its hard to find one that does all three. \n\nIf the wife wasn't involved, you'd need a chef/secretary which will run you about 50k a year, and you'd need a hooker for about 150k a year (blue chips only for Karp), so the cost is the same as hiring your wife. But now if you want to eat caviar while getting your dick sucked, you'd have to talk to two people not just one.And tendies lolThanks for the help / info! Just getting started in this stuff so trying to understand the research behind all the moves if anything (not expecting to make money at all, perfectly happy to lose it all learning) - any resources you'd recommend for fairly new people?Are you saying it\u2019s going to run up through the presentation, or what[removed]I\u2019m literally always worried.

PLTR has brought me so much!There's a lot of dumb rocket emojis around and posts with no info in them, but pltr isn't over, it hasn't even started.\n\nPeople in here trying to get rich quick lose interest when something doesn't gain 100% in a day but that doesn't mean shit.Only 25k?!

If your own DD does not support your play, you shouldn\u2019t put any money in it.Yes it definitely fucking matters if you came from Stanford, go to a job interview once in your life and you'll know what I'm talking about.Dont ever sell options. Play with shares preferably. avoid buying short dated options. New traders over trade, have some patience. Do your own research and form an investment theory before buying anything, and dont rely on the DD on WSBs. If you are reading DD here evaluate the poster as well as the post, shills are not uncommon. The real DD is always in the comments..  wsb has made me big money and some painful losses.

Maybe buy a couple leaps for yourself, but keep on buying them shares.Yes lolReddit this is RedditeTrade has a screener for unusual options activity.Short term was the investor conferences and the fb settlement... However it's just like everyone still thinks blackberry sells phones and their entrance into the EV market with their software and partnerships with big companies could lead you to believe it's very undervalued. That and all the hype could lead to shorts needing to cover at least temporarily and it could be really lucrative short term.\n\nRegardless of the above, long term they have a lot of fcf from selling their patents and the fb settlement which in turn should quash any possibility of them going bankrupt before something big happens, which is why I think it was so cheap to begin with.Hold on \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Just do thing they tell you and the stonk go up.No this bitch going to 25+ in a very short time your going to be a very happy person.Put your seatbelt on and be ready to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Premium?\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8I will be messaging you in 2 days on [**2021-01-18 23:58:48 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-01-18%2023:58:48%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypduj/bb_call_volume_2200_higher_than_usual_we_did_it/gjirdas/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fkypduj%2Fbb_call_volume_2200_higher_than_usual_we_did_it%2Fgjirdas%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-01-18%2023%3A58%3A48%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20kypduj)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|Sexy fuckerAin\u2019t nothing wrong with that.

Long dated near the money calls on sound companies is about as safe as you can getWhat is your break even? $11 June isn\u2019t too far fetched. But if you paid a ridiculous premium, it might be an impossibility. Just trying to be realistic for you. My autistic ass is sitting on hype juiced 10c 11.5c and 12c. For 1/29. Thank god what small intelligence I have said to only buy  1 12cThese will print well. \n\nGrabbed 1/21/22 $5c LEAPS last Tuesday. I haven\u2019t stopped squirting since Wednesday afternoon.

I have no idea what I'm doing but I've spent $200 on dumber shit. June sounds alot safer thoyoure fine man. Thats the thing with options, if theyre long dated theyre safe and usually always print, but the premiums will end up costing a little more. look near the money unless you think theyre gonna blast off . im 10c 1/22 lolAdd shares to upgrade seats\n\n\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8I'd rather have you tattoo your reddit avatar on your leg or somethingHe I have been hyping BB all week I expect my face to be tattooed on your chest over your heart.We could drink together \ud83c\udf7bThey also sold 90 smart phone patents. \n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/Buying shares too. Getting rid of my 600 Palantir bags.I\u2019m in to buy BB shares on Tuesday open. Let\u2019s gooooo12.5c 1/29 \ud83d\udc8emf\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffdHigher risk, higher rewardAlso cheaper per contract. Most WSB retards are broke and the cheapest contracts are OTM weekliesPhone or fruit?Ok but will my 250 shares make me rich?what about like 1000 shares at 9.80I sold 455 shares of GME at a loss so I\u2019ve been a paper handed pussy before.  Not anymore BB!Same as a stock, if a lot of people are trying to buy a certain option, the price will increase even if the value of the underlying remains the same.But is it enough?Easy a 30 dollar stock, easy there EV OS shits on everyone's else.He meant this week guys!!\n\n\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8The ui is sexyIs there a difference between etrade and power etrade?It's OS software shits on everyone else's there is a reason that the companies that are using it have over 60% of the EV market. They also have a deal signed with Sony and Amazon to use OS from them, and they are going into cyber security as well.\nEdit:\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80So that would mean shares are the playI\u2019m sitting on my first calls ever bought- 7.5c 1/22 for 0.55 premium... also bought 2/19 8c for 1.78. Trying to figure out if i should have sold Friday afternoon as I don\u2019t know how value will decay as I approach 1/22thanks!First time I been called a retard, ThanksGang Gang!I don't like that attitude.I appreciate the encouraging words! Got 50 shares as well, actually feel pretty good about them making a comeback in a new-to-them industry.Break even is 13.90. premium was pretty bad, I bought the dip yesterday. Wish you luck on those calls though!I did one contract for my first one.  Pretty sure I threw $197 away.  $15 Expires 1/22 lolI have 3/19 10c x20 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I also picked up 65 FridayI meant the CEO's face my bad lolLike have something like 35 or 40 thousand patents. So it going to be good the stock is going to rise, boomers a just trying to short sell to make it tumble so people sell out then they can buy it all up and make the tendies. We will be fine after the money starts coming back in from EV companies that use their OS and Amazon and Sony develops their EV more which used the OS.Same!Rich? No. Happy? YesJust do the thing they say to do and stonks go up.We all have paid to learn lessons\n\n\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8Can confirmthis is the way.. otherwise my calls are worthless \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80cylance enters the chatYeah security is king for EV/auto too.  bB has always been a leader in that field.Heavy shares and LEAPS\n\n\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8You are solid. Nice work. Roll forward and add shares with your tendiesliarWe are here to make that happen, gonna suck if you miss by just a couple days though.Will my measly 78 shares make me rich?So true man.  I\u2019m a rookie investor, but damn what a stock to miss out on.  Happy for GME gang though! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Thank you for the confirmation bias that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for haha but obviously the coming week could bring anything but is there a rule of thumb on selling x days prior to expiration?Yep.

I entered LMND 100@$91 and sold  @$125, within a week it hit $181. Gains are gains but that taught me to trust my gut more.

Pure majestic autism. \n\nI come out of Plato\u2019s cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into 3/19 6c\u2019s on the DD that: \u201cwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there\u201d ... that\u2019s it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5\u2019s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn\u2019t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo\u2019s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn\u2019t bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it\u2019s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy\u2019s) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it\u2019s really fine. Look at what\u2019s happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don\u2019t know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n\n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUALLY. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race \ud83c\udf4e\u2014it\u2019s huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n\n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God\u2019s work \n\n6) IOT, AI, smart city\u2019s, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I\u2019ve trimmed half the options, I don\u2019t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I\u2019m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette\u2019s syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO\u2019s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they\u2019re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally \u201cfree money\u201d \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands \ud83d\ude4c\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB", "score": 1122, "comment": "Thanks for your condolences and advices. I\u2019m all in and down $11,000 already also I owe the IRS $4,000 for my imaginary gains in 2020 (just lost all my 2020 gains). BB will soar or my life is over! I will not sell!!!!!!!!!I didn't read anything... just skipped to the bottom and saw \"diamond hand $BB\"... that made sense... so buying more on Tuesday open!I read all of this. Made me Happier.You couldn't be more correct. Eveything there is to find about this company is awesome, yet it's only at 5.5B market cap. \n\nThe volume is weird imo too, as well as us wsb'ers randomly picking it up roughly at the same time. I agree that this volume can't be us. There is however quite a probable explanation: BB came in the media a couple of times with positive news: Amazon partnership (huh wait what BB is in another industry than phones; EV's?!), Patent selling (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones?!), Facebook settlement (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones and has balls of steel?!)\n\nPeople are realising it's no longer the very good phone company that lost market share, it's now the very good company that does cybersecurity and is part of the EV supply chain.You had me at $BB! Got shares and sold some CC's at the top.BlackBerry\u2019s patents alone are worth over $4 billion - about the same as the current market cap. The market has been pricing bankruptcy/irrelevancy for a long time, once growth returns it\u2019ll get assigned some fair multiples and the stock price will be 4-5x what it is right now.More rockets.Best campfire story ever.

Just buy and hold you cucks. \ud83d\ude0eHolding 4k shares here. Thanks for taking your time to comfort us. You are a good man.Preach. Bought DEEP ITM calls 6/2021 Friday at close cuz IV is bonkersBought 2/19 16c. Is that more reasonable and realistic?1/22 11c reporting for dutyI\u2019ve been involved with BB technology for 15 years now and rode through their mobile demise.\n\nIf you look for analysts comments over the past years you\u2019ll see a trend.  Undervalued.  Lots of cash on hand.  Huge IP buried in their basement.  Government contracts. Industrial/nuclear supply chain.\n\nThen nearly every analyst talks about their phones.  BB exited the phone market like 5 years ago.  That\u2019s an eternity in the phone industry.  The don\u2019t mention that BB tech is already in nearly every other new car on the road, nor do they mention how they\u2019ve been working on car automation for years now.\n\nThey also don\u2019t mention how they have existing relationships and dedicated infrastructure with every cellular carrier in the world, left over from their mobile phones.  Would a dedicated network independent from the internet, certified for DoD use, that could connect to every car in the world with mobile service be useful for the next generation of smart cars?\n\nBB is one of those tech stocks that I bought just to sit on and wait until i was retired, so I don\u2019t have to wash my yacht myself.My gut is telling me this is AMD sub $10 all over again. It was magical seeing AMD climb the way it did from 2016 until now \n\nHope BB follows the same pathI am gonna do YOLO on BB after GME. Already own 200 shares and some options! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Agreed I bought 600 shares at 11.50.

Never again!Thanks op for boosting the confidence. Bought some almost at the top, was afraid to buy more when it dropped on Friday. Might pick up more after reading this \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80BB is the chick you had in highschool with glasses and pimples. No one wanted to fuck her. Neither did you. One day a guy named Jef said \" Damn i havent fked in years...i need some easy pussy\". He walked down the hallway to find his prey. BB accidentally bumped him and her books scattered. Jef looks at her and says \"why the hell not\". BB became popular in one night, throwed away the glasses and let her hair loose. *She was a 10 all along * you thought. You tried to approach her, but now you cant afford her. Ten years later and BB is married to Jeff and she cost more than your 1 bedroom house. And there you are....bald and lonley drinking in a bar at a happy hour thinking why are you so fking retarded. \n\n\nBuy BB BOYS AND HOLD FOR YEARSStay strong brothers. It's getting the attention from bigger players, finally. BB was trying to implement synergies with the Cylance acquisition. People are arguing the CEO has done nothing so far with Cylance. Whoever thinks you can successfully create synergies under 1-2 year without hiccups and burning through some cash is a retarded analyst. Plus the synergies are finally working out, and the hiccups are going away. This is primed for growth. Give it time and it will moon... No it will fucking leave this universe.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Me after reading none of that and seeing a rocket in the title:\n\nYou son of a bitch I'm inYes.

Without some kind of public-facing change in marketing it just won't matter.\n\nMy guess is that is what will happen. There will be a major marketing campaign that will shift the way the world sees \"Blackberry\". Most of the people here are thinking \"phone\" because that is what their brand is, and I meant, \"is\", not \"was\", because we still don't have anything else to cling to for the company; they do a lot, sort of like Nokia, but no one knows what they do nor do they care and the world keeps trucking.\n\nThat has to change. I think Chen knows this. We will see.Very nice DD. I\u2019m in for all of those reasons as well, and when I say in I mean ballz fucking deep. And like someone else said, just look at John Chen! There is no way that fucker is not making us rich\n\nBB will \ud83d\ude80 X2 X3 X4 X5 and maybe more from where is now.

That shall be done by next Wednesday\n\nSold 15c 3 weeks out. Not gonna sell any cc for less than a 40% move. Gonna rotate them cc with max of 3 weeks out and min of 40% up\n\nFucking premium can wait because selling cc on a 50 bucks stock is 5x more than a 10 bucks stock assuming everything is the same\n\nThanks for posting.Im a small fry.

Doubled my account value. I called my friend Thursday morning telling him I\u2019m turning on margin and leveraging everything on 8C... shoulda coulda woulda.\nLike the Op said, she\u2019s oblivious to news sometimes, sometimes she goes for 50% in two days. \n\nI think the news wasn\u2019t the issue it was about cash on hand. BB is established, we know this- can they successfully create this new ecosystem and moon? Sure but it\u2019s gonna cost money. Between the fb settlement and then the selling of patents I think that showed wallstreet they will be doing this right.\n\n- integrated workshops in tier 1 factories(generation of peripheral $) in order to help facilitate the adaptation of ivy.

I made some small tendies with a 1/22 10c But I let it bleed a lot of value like a true autist. I have 300 shares @ 10.20 so I took a small beating and it's possible the next couple weeks won't be kind but I'm comfortable holding the position for awhile and possibly buying more if it continues to dip.Bought a couple of leaps and sitting on them until climax time.Been holding 1000 shares @ 8.07 since Feb 2019.\n\nLet's fucking go already.Fuck bruh I bought shares and calls at the peak fuck my life .. holding tho \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffcEven with the big dip down it was up 5 percent for the day.

Also that money I made in 2020 was money I lost in 2019.never seen such accurate comments, diamond hands to your palladium ballsAlmost 153M+ in volume on Friday. 65M on Thursday.\n\nAverage volume is 20M with a short position of 16%. Way bearish. Those fuckers are probably sitting at close to 50% heading into Tuesday after pushing price down on volume because of puts bought at 10 or less and options on the same day. For a 3-day weekend they\u2019re holding this position!? Balls but stupidity. If you want to fuck done shorts this week, then BB is it on them covering that run-up.Hmmm interestingIf you check the GME chart it had near identical movement on Friday. I also suspected something was up. I figured maybe it had to do with the insane option activity on these. I don\u2019t know too much about how market makers work but from my understanding.. as the weekly calls get closer to expiring worthless, the MMs start selling the shares. On top of this, the overall red market, people taking profits, and day trading shorts.Why would someone bleed it before a three day weekend?Unless it goes to the moon right?I sold the 1/29  15c for 1.30 - was a bit later on but still good to average down.and BB didn't grow at all \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Canada's finest1.2 years here; we've certainly had our ups and downs, but things are really good lately \ud83d\ude0cIndeed, I thought like a retard that I bought the top with GME being at 28$, don't do that shitI need in \ud83d\ude80It's actually less risky than holding stock. While it runs the risk of total loss, you get 100 shares of leverage for a lower price. If the stock drops, you're still fucked either way. The only issue is liquidity (sometimes).\n\nIt works better with lower IV, but there's still a benefit.first of all:\n\nif you buy 100 shares it'll cost you 1000$, if you buy the right to 100 shares it cost you 890$, if you end up exercising you pay another 100 $. same price if you actually want the shares but cheaper if you just plan on selling the option.\n\nSecond of all:\n\nOptions prices grow exponentially while stock prices move slowly. essentially for the 1c contract for June, if the price goes down it's no different than buying shares. if the price goes up \\*quickly\\* you'd make a larger profit than holding shares.My mt.

Due to the GME effect, I scooped up BB with no hesitation to test the water\ud83d\ude02you guys are awesome here, thanks for the encouragement!Good point. I need to look at it less. I have no problem holding it long term. Just could not tell if it was a pump and dump on Friday. After reading some DD, I think I'm comfortable holding it long term.Did you put the \u201c$\u201d ?

WSB advertises every position by nature so front running them will be easy enough. \n\nI think we will see more and more bear traps on meme stocks. Don't give in to fear and greed and it will be less effective. \n\nI am also a bit cynical so could be my own bias talking.Maybe they knew people would FOMO in hard after the previous days run up. Maybe funds are trolling WSB now and setting bear traps with pump and dumps. IDK .. all I know is they did it to make money.\n\nedit: the fomo would skyrocket seeing the 25% pre-market pump making people think it was the next GME .. worked on me but i'm holding for as long as it takes.BB has been short sold for a while now and they increased volume from 14% to 16% recently. TUTES are at about 53%. Extremely bearish. Options were up on Friday and a lot of puts bought. Shorts are covering this week from that pretty big increase of close to 50% of their volume. Maybe part of the reason.Thats always the \"risk\" when playing theta gang.

It'll pay off in the end.Lol it isn't less risky to buy options vs shares. The whole point of buying derivatives/leverage (unless a hedge) is to increase your risk-return.While this is true, we need people manning the share pumps too. The only way your options value goes up is if share price goes up, and for share price to go up, people have to be buying shares.Probably too optimistic w/ breakevent point, but 01/22 at 15c is a lot more rough at this point.Just hold and you may be okay.

Not TSX. \ud83e\udd37Bingo. The only reason they had a bad ER last month was because global auto  production froze in April and May and has remained constrained since then due to COVID supply chain issues and safety regulations, and consequently QNX revenues fell. QNX revenue will return to normal next year, and the growth trend will resume. Cyber Suite is being scaled up and marketed to more customers and IVY will ship in 2022. ARR will keep increasing for the foreseeable future. The current stock price is about 1/2 of what BB should be worth based on their past p/s multiple at roughly this level of revenue in 2005 when they had growth. Once growth returns, this is a $25 stock, easily. Might take a couple years, though. Might even take until 2022 when IVY drops, although if they give us a hint as to what kind of revenue it will bring in, we can price that in and get to $25 a lot sooner. If Chen is smart, he will iron out the financial side of the IVY deal ASAP and start giving projections NOW, because the market conditions for pumping the stock past $30 (he gets a fat bonus check if this happens) have never been better.\n\nIt's all gonna ride on how management communicates. We need IVY revenue projections, we need bullish sales targets for Cyber Suite, and the CEO straight-up saying that the stock is undervalued because it is. Interest rates are low so a debt financed buyback program that buys at any price under $10 might not hurt either and would back up the \"our stock is undervalued\" rhetoric. Combine all that with >10% YoY revenue growth and you have the perfect turnaround story.I dunno man these are the same dudes who will be buying at $20 and sleeping on a good deallooks like your account is a prime example of a pump account.  literally no post history other than shilling BB.  also, you're certainly very adept at reading financials.  congrats on showing data from over a year ago that backs up their last earnings demonstrating they can't make any fucking money.This man is at the roulette table telling you he has a game winning system lmao.The downside risk is total loss of the investment, but it cannot go further than that. If I buy 100 $10 shares, and the bitch collapses to $1 two years later, I'm out $900. If I buy a $5 strike option for $6.00 and it drops to $1, I'm out $600. The downside risk is mitigated. The only place of higher risk is in the $4 to $5 range at expiration.\n\nLEAPS are not roulette.if you buy an option contract. the guy selling you the contract has to buy shares incase you want to exercise the contract.teetering on an ass fucking \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23this is the way my dude. also selling CCPs to take advantage of the insane IVjust buy more, that average will go down!\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80yes I am home now.

I don\u2019t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.\n\n$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn\u2019t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I\u2019m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Case: \n\n1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  \n\nThe digital game sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the \ud83d\udc3b are right, but they\u2019re right in 8 years which means they\u2019re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more\npeople go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don\u2019t care about the fractionally\nlarger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. \n\nBlockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster\u2019s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster\u2019s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.\n\nGamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  \n\nEveryone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.\n\n2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt\n\nThis is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.\n\n3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.\n\nGamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.\n\nGamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a \"digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment\"\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Case\n\nThis MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  \n\nThis has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you\u2019re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don\u2019t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  \n\nSimply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?\n\n\nTLDR:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 But not because of the MOASS.", "score": 91, "comment": "**If this is [spam](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide) you can vote to remove it and earn setting your own flair.**\n\n| **Remove It (0)** | **Keep It (1)** |\n|--------|:-------|-------:|:------:|\n| [Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=kyyoa0&message=spam) | [Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=kyyoa0&message=approve)|\n\n[Click Here to Change Inaccurate Post Flair](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=postflair%20CHANGEME&message=kyyoa0)\n___\n ^comment ^will ^disappear ^--- ^21 ^shitposts ^removed ^since ^last ^crash ^--- ^[information](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot) ^--- ^[leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard) ^--- ^[REWARDS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot_commands)I\u2019m doubling down on Tuesday. \ud83d\ude80>They\u2019re pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.\n\nRyan Cohen follows *only* 4 accounts on Twitter: WSJ, Financial Times, Geekwire, and.........**PC GAMER**.\n\nHe knows **exactly** what he\u2019s doing.\n\nShorts and gay bears are absolutely fucked. He was subtly warning them for *weeks* on Twitter to get the fuck out but they didn\u2019t listen and now they will incur the wrath of his giant 420.69 foot Chewy cock. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Another bull case is that sideways churn hurts bears way more than bulls with the interest they're paying. If it goes up, bears lose. If it goes sideways, bears lose. If it goes down and some bears cover, it goes back up and rest of bears lose.\n\nBears right now are rats on a sinking (rising) ship. As soon as any news comes out that GME is on a turnaround they will eat each other alive to get out.As an inexperienced trader, the build up to the big squeeze has been very stressful\u2014despite the obvious, massive opportunity, I\u2019m convinced I\u2019ll find a way to cuck myself into little or no profit. I\u2019ve seriously developed an uncontrollable and absolutely infuriating eye twitch from thinking about it.\n\nI\u2019ve read god knows how many $GME posts over the past week and none of them provided the kind of cathartic confirmation bias you\u2019ve just given me. Because, whence the squeeze hath been squozzed, this will still be a great company, with great leadership and a bright future and that\u2019s something I want to be a part of. \n\nGME REENTRY AFTER I GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE MOON \ud83d\ude80Long live Cohen. Long live Roaring Kitty. Long live Rod. Long $GMEThe only point you need:\n\nA digital download of Cyberpunk was $60. A physical copy for PC with the OST officially printed, with stickers, box art, a physical map and a necklace of Samurai\u2019s logo was $60.\n\nWho got the better value?Well written, rational DD.  Thank you.\u201cThe digital sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b arguments, is weak\u201d\n\nSomebody give this man an awardBro dont you ever put GME and Blockbuster in the same DDThis guy's last post was 7 years ago and about japanese watches. I don't knows seems fishyToo many wordsI don\u2019t understand how they think there will be a digital store.  \n\nIf I want to download a new ps4 game.... it comes from the PlayStation store.  There\u2019s no reason why they would add a middle man like GameStop for a download actually makes zero sense.Go back to r/stocks with this garbage DDValue stocks? Idk sounds kinda gay to meSame here. What\u2019s another thousand now when we\u2019re literally going to the moon \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I have no idea what GME will do if it does squeeze, but it might not be just a rise and it sets there.  Or it might.   Point being I think some people will be caught off guard, depending on what it does.   If the squeeze is more gradual then it's going to be like boiling a frog -- so slow you may not recognize it.   If the squeeze is sudden, you may miss it by holding out too long before it dips down (provided it dips down).  I think the VW squeeze only lasted 4 or so days as a massive sharp spike before the price came way down (and never returned to peak squeeze price).\n\nThis could be tricky if you're trying to predict the absolute top.   I can't tell you what to do as I'm not a financial advisor or expert, but I already have limits set to auto sell my shares at various prices in chunks.  I won't be kicking myself if it shoots much higher though, because really gain is gain in my book.  As long as I don't sell below my average cost I'm pretty happy.\n\nI do wonder if this is going to last months until the next Earnings Report or if it will be sooner.   (Or if it never truly squeezes in the way we are expecting)If you bought shares sit back and enjoy the ride. Remember you\u2019re not the one on borrowed time, shorts are. We have no time limit. We\u2019re playing a staring contest but shorts don\u2019t realize we\u2019re blind (and retarded).You know what else is long?  \ud83c\udf46Honestly, the digital copy is more valuable to me. IDGAF about stickers and art and I do like not having to leave the house.Check the price of the other watch I posted.thats what the TLDR is forSteam, epic launcher, blizzard... games are more then console.If you're bad at thinking, try reading things that smarter people have thought of.\n\n1. Cross-platform downloads. That's right, it can be downloaded and played on PC and consoles for one cost.\n\n2. Money back on digital \"returns\" means less of a cost commitment than literally any other download service.\n\n3. Physical stores switching to PC-building stores, which opens up custom builds to the majority of people who are too dumb and/or lazy to build one themselves.\n\nMicrosoft just agreed to give GME a percentage of *all* downloads from the Microsoft store. Do you really think your 30 seconds of \"thought\" is smarter than all of Microsoft's management? GME is going to be the comeback of the decade, and everyone knows it except for Melvin and people like you.I think memberships are key. Not sure if that\u2019s in their plan, but it could potentially play a huge role in how they incentivize people to buy. If they make enough from subscribers, the games could come with a lower price tag. Almost everything is subscription based now days. I could be wrong though.I believe they are also getting a cut of all digital sales in the xbox shop for xboxes sold through Gamestop.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_comingBecause they\u2019re shifting their focus from software to hardware.

It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.\n\nFirst, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. \n\nQ3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)\n\n* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  \n\n   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.\n   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.\n* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.\n* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.\n* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.\n* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.\n\nQ4 Preliminary Results:\n\n[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)\n\n* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.\n* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.\n\nIt smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. \n\n*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:\n\n\\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.\n\n\\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)\n\n\\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)\n\nFubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, on to the NBA:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)\n\n\"Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV\u2019s formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world \u2013 Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.\"\n\nDavid Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.\n\nWhy am I bringing up the NBA?\n\n[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)\n\nPeople are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. \n\nThe NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, lets look into two key acquisitions: \n\n\\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. \n\nBalto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)\n\n34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. \n\nSince the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. \n\nShort term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.\n\nLong term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute.", "score": 82, "comment": "Buy calls ASAP, show those \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bI don't even know what fubo TV is and I have calls, tf is wrong with the rest of you?You wrote this report?\n\nWhat\u2019s your process for DD?

Willoughby at\u00a0newaction@pomlaw.com\u00a0or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.\nThe investigation concerns whether fuboTV and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.JjI did write this.\n\nGraduated USC, ran the accounting department of a local commercial real estate company until 2020 until i realized commercial real estates future looked pretty bleak and left to develop low income housing projects with my partner. This gave me a lot more free time to delve into stocks and I really like what I see from Fubo. We do a lot of DD in commercial real estate and I was always taught that it\u2019s more important to look for reasons not to buy a property.\n\nMy DD just comes from being obsessed in finding as much about a company as I can. I scour twitter and stocktwits for leads to research and fact check, and in doing so I find and connect missing pieces. My process is to try and find anything to convince myself NOT to invest in a hype stock such as this one, and so far the only red flags I see are those typical of high growth startups that aren\u2019t profitable yet. This always comes with scale, and Fubo is on the way.Use thinkorswim or any of the many websites with company financials and earnings/growth data.Did you ever give a look to the info in the investor relation section of a firm? that's where you should start your DDFubo isn\u2019t a Chinese stock though.

You referenced Netflix a few times but they were one of the first streaming platforms and therefore had a huge advantage to gain their foothold and acquire customers for much cheaper.\n\nI really like their plan of integrating sports and live betting as it has massive potential, but what\u2019s to stop every other network and streaming service from doing the same thing? Once it\u2019s federally legalized I\u2019m sure platforms like Amazon/YouTube tv/Hulu/espn+/cable networks etc will all jump on board and already have a significant scale and funding advantage. \n\nI\u2019m intrigued by Fubo and have considered jumping in (so thanks for the write-up), but that\u2019s the main thing holding me back. You\u2019ve clearly done a lot more research than me so please feel free to tell me why I\u2019m wrong.I appreciate the response, it\u2019s helpful. I think your background in accounting also helps a lot when it comes to interpreting earnings reports as well... yes, being skeptical is very important. Most people tend to seek information to confirm their bias- glad you\u2019re smart enough to do the opposite.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about fundamentals, but I do know about unusual options activity. And there\u2019s been some significant calls sweeps in FUBO recently... they\u2019ve been buying every dip so far. I followed the call sweepers and picked up some February calls on Friday... maybe if we get a little volatility this week, I can get some cheaper shares too.This IS the wayThanks, I actually didn\u2019t even consider thinkorswim. But I have seen the tab where I can research a company. I\u2019ll give that a try.I have. I usually see press releases or power point presentations designed to get investors excited about the company... it is a good start, but doesn\u2019t usually enlighten me much.Certainly\n\n>fuboTV, Inc. is a digital entertainment company. The company is focused on offering consumers a live television (TV) streaming platform for sports, news and entertainment through fuboTV. fuboTV is a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) that streams in 4K. Its subscription-based services are offered to consumers who can sign-up for accounts at https://fubo.tv, through which it provides basic plans with the flexibility for consumers to purchase the add-ons and features suited for them. **The company was founded by David Gandler, Alberto Horihuela Suarez, and Sung Ho Choi on February 20, 2009 and is headquartered in New York, NY.**\n\n(https://money.cnn.com/quote/profile/profile.html?symb=CRCOD)It is not shameful! It is just important since you made a comment about profitability; it wasn't even off the ground for 6 years.This is actually a key metric companies like Netflix uses strategically \n\nhttps://innovationtactics.com/contribution-margin-learn-netflix/\n\nPretty absurd how many people fall for these tacticsHere is original link\n\nhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-pomerantz-law-firm-043000181.htmlThere\u2019s nothing proprietary about it, you\u2019re right. However, being the first to do it, do it right, and market it correctly has it\u2019s advantages. \n\nTheoretically anyone can make another Netflix; hell, I made a copy for a post-grad CS project. The difference is Netflix did it first, they had the right positioning and infrastructure as cable-cutting was taking off. \n\nIf FUBO can do the same with integrated sports betting and discounted cable packages, I\u2019d say they have a brand.That\u2019s kind of like asking what\u2019s stopping yahoo from launching a sports betting platform like DraftKings since yahoo is primarily what people use for fantasy leagues.\n\nYahoo is not likely to enter the sports betting space as it can be considered a conflict of interest for them. Same can be said for ESPN+.  These companies are more likely to partner with fubo than be direct competitors. \n\nAmazon and Hulu are also just getting into content creation, trailing Netflix by years. They are waiting to see how sports betting pans out with companies like fubo before entering themselves, if at all. Fubo will have first mover advantage, which is huge.studying the annual report instead of the synthetic pp presentation imo is a necessity if you are thinking to give money to a firmYeah maybe. I don\u2019t know if companies are waiting to see if it works for Fubo before doing it themselves, it\u2019s more the whole \u201cnot being federally legal\u201d thing holding them back. \n\nThey will have the first mover advantage, but it\u2019s going to be a very slim/short advantage before there\u2019s plenty of other options in the space. It will need to be a fantastic product and user experience to maintain that edge. I personally haven\u2019t used it or have any friends that use it, and of course the Sportsbook and integration of that is yet to happen, so I can\u2019t speak to what the product is like. \n\nSomebody is going to make a ton of money in this space, and it could very well end up being Fubo if the company is run well and has a good marketing team. So just for that potential I\u2019ll probably open a position to go along with my dkng and penn, especially if it dips a little more!Yahoo is literally in the sports betting / daily fantasy business:\n\nhttps://sports.yahoo.com/dailyfantasy", "linkFlairText": "DD", "totalAwardsReceived": 2, "rating": 2.2363048490410358}, {"id": "kyyg41", "stockTicker": "TLRY", "title": "$TLRY \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selfText": "", "score": 19, "comment": "APHA is where the real  **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** are2/19 20c and 3/19 22cGod speed autist.

If you paid a $3 premium then you need BB to reach $13 to at least break even. The cost of the contract is premium price x 100 so for my example that single contract would cost $300.

Because like the other person said; BB is Canadian and trades on TSX which is open Monday.Frustration. I was 30% up and lost all. I learned now. Next time first I will take profit and then reinvest.There hasn\u2019t been a catalyst.

I lucked into this call when I trusted a random stranger. Thank God I have 2 months to sort out what to do with it.\n\nBut I feel like the next time it says +$300, I should sell it.If you own the call contract, it\u2019s your option to exercise, not someone else\u2019s.thanks i appreciate the info..so why is it that when buying calls the lower the strike price like below the share price the more expensive the premium is?Physical Education rate, duh.As long as you aren't shorting or buying puts a squeeze is good and means \ud83d\ude80 value.A short squeeze is when those who sold without owning the shares (shorts) are forced into buying shares because they don't believe it'll go down anymore or because they run out of margin *and* there is more demand than supply. \n\nIt means shareholders can basically dictate the price they are willing to sell to the shorts, because the shorts *have* to cover their losses.\n\nThat's my understanding anyway, but I'm retarded.Monday it is! Thanks for reminding meYou should have stayed in still 10% growth in 2 days when the market opens Tuesday it\u2019ll start moving back upYou didn't lose it.

Those contracts are called \u201cin the money\u201d. If the strike price is higher than the current price it\u2019s called \u201cout of the money\u201d. When it\u2019s out of the money you need to hope and count on the stock going up a ton more and therefore it\u2019s more risky so it\u2019s cheaper. There are a ton of things to consider which I can\u2019t go into depth here but I recommend checking YouTube for more explanation. Good luck!It\u2019s not pltr earnings????Im too inexperienced to fuck with calls and puts. Im only buying shares currentlyHow can you be so sure?so lets say i buy a $12 Call for 6/18 for $BB for 10 contracts with premium of 2.41 totaling a Max Cost of $2410, at worse case scenario if i dont reach past the break even number 14.41 by the expiration date, the worse that can happen is i lose all of the $2410 right? i cant lose any more than that to a point where they'll take more money out from my bank or from my buying power? sorry for the retard questions i feel at home\ud83e\udd23thankss again \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffcNo worries friend, the most you can lose is the premium that you paid for the contracts. Google options profit calculator and you can see what you stand to gain/lose at different dates in the future and at different share prices. It is quite useful.You have lot of patience....good man...Using a googled calculator, my \"entry cost\" = \"premium-or-price per option\" x 100?  That is the cost to \"get in\" and if I choose not to exercise by the expiration date, I only lose that amount, correct?\n\nIf one has strong conviction a stock will go up 100% in 2 months and the cost to get in is only $170, it seems like a no brainer (I know, nothing is guaranteed)to use BB as an example (i'm completely inventing these numbers):\n\nsay BB is at $10, and you buy a call option for $3.50 with a march expiration date. you will pay $350 (3.50x100) for that. That gives you the right, but not obligation, to buy 100 shares of BB for $10/each on or before March of this year.\n\nIf the share price is below $10 it's utterly worthless, and if it's below $13.50 it's not worthless but still you lost money on the deal overall. When buying this call, the max you can lose is the $350 you paid for it.\n\nIf BB is at $20 in march, the call will theoretically be worth $10 (the difference between 10 and 20 is 10, x100=$1000). Thus you've turned your initial $350 into $1000. Pretty cool. But, if it's worth $9, you get nothing. If it's worth $12, it's worth $2 (aka $200), which means you didn't completely go bust but still lost $150 on the deal.\n\nIn this last case (it's $12 in March) spending $1000 on shares would have netted you a 20% return, whereas by buying a call you lost $150. As with everything in the financial world, there's a risk/reward at play - options are greater risk with greater reward.\n\nAlso be very cautious anytime you feel yourself having \"strong conviction\\[s\\] that a stock will go up 100% in 2 months\", as those generally tend not to play out. I hope it does, and if it did, owning a call option would be a great play. But if you're not experienced in trading options, please go easy until you understand your risk tolerance and how much you can afford to lose, because sometimes you'll hit big and all is right with the world, other times you lose it all and spiral into a void of self-loathing.

Recently, I decided why not both?\n\nA little background: GM has some short term catalysts in 2021 as a recovery play. It sold the most trucks in the US in 2020 and apparently isn\u2019t yet affected by a semiconductor shortage that is forcing Ford to idle some plants, but the real story here is Cruise.\n\nGM owns Cruise, the SF-based autonomous vehicle technology company, that plans to offer autonomous taxi and delivery services. The total addressable market is $5-8 trillion according to the Cruise CEO. \n\n\u201cDan Ammann, CEO of the GM majority-owned autonomous vehicle subsidiary, on Wednesday said that valuation includes autonomous ride-hailing services to compete against current companies such as Uber and Lyft at a potentially $5 trillion sector; $2 trillion for freight; and $500 billion each for data insights and in-vehicle experiences.\u201d Source: [CNBC ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/gms-cruise-values-autonomous-vehicle-industry-at-8-trillion.html) \n\n*Why now?*\n\n1) Cruise had once aimed to launch a commercial service using so-called \u2018driverless\u2019 vehicles by the end of 2019 (so they must have thought they were pretty close). Cruise started fully autonomous taxi service in SF in December 2020\n\n2) In January, Cruise hired the former COO of Delta, another pretty strong signal they are getting ready for commercialization.\n\n3) In a recent earnings call, GM CEO indicated they were open to a sale of Cruise which was last valued at $19bn. In this market, if they show any sign of progress, should be $100bn (vs current market cap of GM of $71bn). If GM retains minority control, it\u2019s all upside. [Deutsche Bank analyst who asked the question on earnings call explains](https://youtu.be/12XMATuP3_0)\n\n4) GM crushed it at CES, unveiling a flying drone and new business called BrightDrop, \u201cecosystem of electric products, software and services to help delivery companies transport goods more efficiently\u201d\n\n*Price Target* \ud83c\udfaf \ud83c\udf1d \n\nIn December, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas raised its price target to $57, USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 30% to account for execution risk. That\u2019s insanely conservative in my opinion, but hey let\u2019s go with it for a second. Back of the napkin, if the present value is $57/share and the discount rate is 30%, that implies a future value of $420.69 in 7.6186 years. This market has been making moves in dog years and Jonas\u2019s call was made in Dec, so that means we celebrating New Years 2022 in tendie town.\n\nBut seriously, I think we are going to $100 this year which Jonas also cited as a \u201cblue sky\u201d bull case. Under that scenario, Cruise is spun off at $100bn valuation.\n\nI\u2019m just sharing my call, not giving advice.

How will they overcome that?Is the cruise taxi service open for all?Didn't GM try to file bankruptcy last crash, tanked everyones shares and then got bailed out by the government and their stockholders got burnt?\nCorrect me if I'm wrong and I'm saying this while sitting in my Chevy, but fuck GM stocks.

They\u2019re throwing billions of dollars at these companies with nothing but fiberglass concept shitboxes that have to be towed behind a pickup.  GM is a lot less vaporous than most. In addition to Cruise, which OP outlined, GM is introducing 12 new EVs led by an unholy 1000hp Hummer.The market isn\u2019t rewarding legacy auto for tech investments and every \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bcomment here proves that point. \n\nFord could be a play too, I haven\u2019t done the DD except that I heard they are having some short term manufacturing issues due to a [chip shortage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-other-auto-makers-cut-output-on-chip-shortage-11610280001) and GM is not impacted as of yetBoo.

Tendies for both gangs, and tendies for you.Lol have you read any of the recent news?  This shit is squeezing like your moms thighs around my head next week.Hey everyone, this guy hates money!we came here for a short squeeze...short interest has only increased in the meanwhile(and quite considerably this week), why would we leave? Main dish is still in the ovenHush. GME now, BB next.Stupid fucker GME didn\u2019t even start to squeezeYou are barely autistic you assholeThey're dealing with some massive fomosame sitting at 36.SameI don\u2019t see it going below $9.00 again after all the consolidation. A lot of people bought a shit ton as it dropped slowly today and the gap was filled up.Just bought 20 shares. That's at least 20 \ud83d\ude80 's right? \ud83e\udd72BB is a boomer product what you mean homie \ud83e\udd21Amen brother \ud83d\ude4fThat's just tendie gang \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8[deleted]Squeeze and a huge drop. How excitingthere is a new tard bornned every dayI bought GME back in November 19. No FOMO here. Just stating the obviousI have the sams45. Every bit countsThere's alot of outstanding shares on BB that's the only thing preventing it from \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80If you've been watching it and in the game since early december, i wouldnt be so sure. It's been unreceptive to other good news. I can see high 7s or low 8s. Low 9 is still a good time to buy because it will definitely go up again next time they announce a partnership. The actual products wont come to fruition until later this year imo and it's a good long term buy if you get in low enough. Anything over 9 is paying too much right now.\u201cBB iS a bOoMEr pRoDUcT\u201d  get off Reddit and do your research homie. Theyre about to be heavily invested in the EV market and looking to integrate their technology by partnering with Amazon. They want to monopolize their technology inside the automotive industry.It's not the same product my guy. They no longer sell phones.You have no idea what a short squeeze is if you think 100% is a lot. Like absolutely no idea.You clearly don\u2019t know what squeeze meansAnd you may be right. I kept looking at the chart from the past month or so and it seems to be consolidating nicely creating a new low and then pushing the wall for a low vertical progression. I\u2019m hoping it lands around $9.00 but may drop below. I have my hands in at $9.65 and excited to hold and see what\u2019s happens with new news.They are already in the top 19 out of 25 EV makers and make up for 61% of the EV markets software. They have already began the monopolization and are succeeding more and more, and now they even got the Sony deal. More and more to come I think.They no longer cell phonesI first got in at 8.40 dec 1st and cost averaged down. If you can, do the same and keep buying it up when it drops lower. It really is a good stock in the long run. Dont paper hands and you'll get your profit eventually. It will probably even rocket later this year. Just wait till you can make a few bucks per share and dont get greedy. Maybe set a trailing stop loss after it goes to 10. You'll be okay but it might take a month or 2. They keep announcing partnerships so just hold strong and you wont lose.\n\nEdit:eh you're still in the green so you're not even in a bad place.

They'll use it as evidence that they should have an even higher paying gig somewhere else.This also helped more WSB 'traders' get in, thus giving us more power after the massive incoming gains\n\nEdit: Oh I see they sold the 13th already \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fA little of both. I'm expecting a temporary squeeze that will make myself and others a fortune, but will use that to try and increase my position. Ryan Cohen taking over makes me very bullish on this long term. At its current state, 80+ per share is justifiable. With a transition to effective e-commerce and Chewy methodology and customer service, it can easily be worth 400+.Why not both?  I\u2019m in love with it, and trying to trade it to the fucking moon.(It\u2019s like watching Zeus come down as a mortal to mingle with humans, and nobody recognizes him...)If they sold at 36, they collectively held less than 80k shares.\n\n\n\nThose have been bought, and then some. \n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Thanks for the confirmation buoysSame!He should run.

They are contracts for the right to sell shares at a certain price. So I sold someone else the right to sell me 2500 shares at $20 by january of next year. If GME stays above that, those contracts expire worthless.When you sell puts, cash collateral gets withheld from you. A $20 strike would be $2000 in collateral. If they expire worthless, you keep all the premium cost. If they get exercised, you lose all the collateral and get 100 shares. If this happens, you still keep the premium which means that you technically bought the shares at a lower cost basis than $20.I would hire them in a second. Took a company left for dead and look where we are now\n\n\ud83d\ude0e \ud83c\udf7aI\u2019m like to say they were trying a spite move to drop a ton of shares and screw the price like it was them being fired that led to a crash.  Backfired in true justiceSame here, I'm in with a lot of shares, will probably take out some, if this squeeze really moons to 200+, but GME will definetly stay as my largest position afterwards so Ryan can work his magicWhat do you foresee Cohen doing to save the company?Same I like GameStopI wonder if Ryan didn\u2019t tweet this week just so he wouldn\u2019t pump up share price even more for these 3 boomer losers.\n\nAnd for anyone reading this that still isn\u2019t following Ryan Cohen on Twitter do yourself a favor and follow him now with notifications turned on. The next time he tweets we will be mooning even more wildly than this week.Thanks for the confirmation boysWe must pool all shares into one accountDuh, it's that thing my wife does with her bf but won't with me right?Can wait 2 days to file after selling I thought?

I know it's nothing like the gains some people see, but for my first call I'm pretty happy.P/S doesn\u2019t indicate how much discounted cash flow the company will bring in. Ford trades at a third of its sales for example, but that\u2019s because they make so little on their sales. BB didn\u2019t make any money in 2020 and the price is 50x 2019 earningsFirst time acting on a WSB advice.

Seems to have solid leadership making smart decisions on how to pivot.  I was watching them through December, and now have opened a small CSP at $9 for next week, genuinely hoping it falls to that level as it's bang-on the standard dev from the 10 days.

Honestly, the business is operating at a big loss and they've been in the automotive business for years now.\n\nThe news with Sony and Huawei are promising, but keep in mind that the first IVY vehicles will be on the road in mid 2023, this is a very long play, and that is IF they actually pull off good unit economics for software revenue. So far, most of their revenue comes from IP licensing, which isn't a very strong growth point.\n\nI probably should have kept my shares in all honestly, feeling a bit salty and FOMOing too here, but it's already up 200% almost since a few weeks ago.

GME to the moon! Bb takes backseatI'm in shares.I'm working on learning to not look at what could have been, and instead be happy with having a good exit strategy and making money. If I play the woulda coulda game, eventually I know I will get burned..Going to buy some PM and then throughout the day.It wouldn't be a PnD if it is undervalued. It's headed to tendie town. If anything the 7% of shorts will probably start to cover as they're getting new deals.Well BB is def gonna go up not down and when it goes up the premium will go up so your total contract price will go up hence it won\u2019t fill. No one gonna sell you a cheap option when the price keeps mooning \ud83d\ude80I mean it depends how much you borrow lolExactly. I'm maxed out now.I mean, if you're trying to save 60 bucks and play it perfect sure, but you could miss out on upside doing that. Or buy in chunks.thank you sir... We all need to help each other out... I am glad to do my part...Up to 45k shares. 15k of those are on margin.Then who is?Hope you're hungry.I\u2019m on this ride baby to the moooooon fellow retards47 shares in let\u2019s ride \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80is there much of a difference between the two for potential jumps??  \n\n\nI;m in NYSE fully and worried I made the wrong move.IM NYSE \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15tsx please :)Shares...Who does this guy think he is giving us sad newsPapa Buffet said it best.\n\nIf you hear counter arguements to your thesis and you get mad, you are gambling.Buying right at open or waiting for dip?Totally.Its heading to ATH despite being a disappointing adventure of a company trying to find a way to market a product and make money. Not sure how you call it undervalued unless you zoom out to when they were the best cellphone manufacturer over a decade ago.Well aren\u2019t the sell options already on the market for sale? I\u2019m confused. The 9.5 option is at .39Don't worry i got fucked \ud83d\ude10Well since they make software for cars and phones and not data analytics or cybersecurity I'll let you decide...Always75 BB share gang checking inYeah, I always feel I'm fucking myself when I buy on NYSE.

They're a software company now.They\u2019re starting partnerships with AMZN and SNEDid your order fill? It won\u2019t fill til open. What you see now for options ends at market close and will update at market open.\n\nOptions can\u2019t be traded after hours or premarket so prices you see are as of 4pm ET yesterday. The price increase in BB after hours and premarket doesn\u2019t get reflected in the option price yet until market opens at 930no idea, I just have a lot of XIU lolBasically stonks go up and they share their wives.Same.I'm aware but what makes them cheap other than their inability to make a profit on software? By the time they open up the market at $11.50 I don't see it as cheap at all.Ahh gotcha. So that\u2019s why GME options are so much more expensive.Cheap on a x rev and compared to competitors.I guess I've just followed and been disappointed in BB for so long I just can't get excited about it again.

But in general, as close to atm during lowest iv and longest time frame for movement, within my budget, is what I look for in plays.15 a year outthey were going to expire, leaving any potential gains on the table anytime after 1/15. adversely potentially paying off though by taking advantage of strike price rather than paid off premium gainsI\u2019m just happy we can get in on this one before it takes off.

Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn\u2019t a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that\u2019s up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:\n\n[https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)\n\nEssentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem. \n\nNeedless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th \ud83d\ude0c)\n\n[https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)\n\nThen in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn\u2019t even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.\n\n**The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE\u2019s COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.\n\nNews on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.\n\nRegardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.\n\nSRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.\n\nIf you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.\n\n*\"I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family,\" Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/)\n\n(Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)\n\nEven after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)\n\nI'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+\n\nAs always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.\n\n**Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.\n\n**TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = \ud83d\ude80. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.\n\nObligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 for good luck", "score": 44, "comment": "thanks for this, actually sounds promising. \ud83d\ude80Some random analyst gave it a price target of $30 around noon today so I picked up 40,  $15 calls lmao.I think at any news or even fomo we could reach $30 by eomWill take a look at this.

I'm always sketched out by biotech plays because they're dependent on their products getting approval. Approval up, no approval down. \n\nI'll take a position on Tuesday though, thanks!This is the wayBeen in this since march, started at 5$ but have since avg'd up and down to land at about 7$ for 820 shares.I hate SRNE but only because their job application looked like a 7 year old made ithaving followed this company for years, I could tell you that this company is a complete piece of shit.... The management is quite incompetent. Not sure how you did your DD and jump to the conclusion that this is a great businessLmao, this is the way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Awesome! I felt bad posting DD about a stock after a big move had already happened, but I figured a lot of people on here saw the move and I thought it would be good to illustrate that it still has some juice in it for the future.\n\nGood luck to you as well!Yeah that's my bad, there's not a big biotech presence on WSB so I wanted to post about SRNE earlier but I kept putting it off because I figured it would be stuck between $7-8 for a little while longer. I was actually waiting for it to come back down to accumulate a few more shares closer to my avg. Then this move today caught me off guard since no news has been released to justify it. But like I said, if any of their products get approved, this 20% move would only be the beginning. \n\nDefinitely do your own research on this one. Like you said, I expect it to be pretty volatile in the near-term until news is released, whether good or bad. In my personal opinion I don't see it going below 7 without news, but again, that's just a feeling from watching this stock since Dec. 2019.\n\nGood luck to you, I hope this moons for both of our sake!!That\u2019s cause mods banned be when I posted pre-pump. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx8k94/speculation_playsrne/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfCould you elaborate on what\u2019s wrong with management? Not arguing, just want to make sure everyone has a full picture of this company after reading this post.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree that the company didn\u2019t do much of anything of value during its first decade or so as a public company, as the chart shows. Even right now, they generated only $28M in revenue through Q3 of 2020 which isn\u2019t great. But my DD was more about giving people an overview of some potential opportunities  in the near future.

So what would you have to do? Sell it or exercise it? (Also idk what it means to exercise it)Nah , you can actually sell a call without buying one first,  you just need to put a margin in to be allowed to do that tho , it's very risky and I don't recommend it . Selling a call outright basically means you are selling someone to buy 100 shares of X stock . You would basically be writing a contract. \n\nWhen you buy a call however you are buying someone else's contract so when you sell it you are basically selling the original contract you bought.When you go to trading options you have the option to buy or sell a call. You can technically sell a call without owning it , if you do this and the buyer of you call excersises his call option you would be held liable for 100 stocks. \n\nIf you buy a call option , let's say  1- $15c 1/29 and then sell it for a profit loss  you wouldn't be held liable since you started with buying a call .\n\nSelling a call outright without buying one first and called shorting and will hold you liable for a chance of assignment.$15C 1/22 LFG \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Godspeed! I bought 165 shares in early December.For sure appreciate it!Grats and fuck you. \nWhat calls are you thinking?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02LmfaoOK IM BUYING IM BUYING LETS GOI laughed so hard coke came out my nose.  Had to cut her hair off and sift it to put it back in there.Sorry, I'm a young buck who's new to this. I hear ya loud and clear!Any ideas then? Otherwise sharesYeah for 1/29I can still sell before 12 pm PACIFIC TIME.  But I am definitely not exercising it.Oh ok thanks for clarifying, it\u2019s taken me two straight days for my autist brain cells to synapse this infoWonder what we are gonna be eating on PlutoYoooo I didn\u2019t selll off them calls wtfThis is a total noob question I can probably just get 6 contracts and I\u2019ll probably do $12c 1/29 but would I make less money if I bought 46 shares instead of the call? Both cost the same amount reallyNo worries . We aren't wall street , we share the wealth mother fucker.  Lets get this money.A call is worth 100 shares. \n\nThe amount of people who have no idea what calls are on this sub is retarded. \n\nYou are buying the option of buying 100 shares at a set price. \n\nSo $12c 1/29 means you are buying the option to buy 100 shares at $12 on the 1/29. \n\nIf the price goes to $13 then you have a contract worth ~ $100. If the price hits $15 then you have a contract worth $300. \n\nIf you buy 6 calls at $12 and the shares hit $15 then you will have contracts worth $3600. \n\nIf you buy 46 shares at $10 and they reach $15 you will have made $230.Dude honestly I\u2019m pretty noobie when it comes to this too, but if u want long term growth, I think u gotta go with the shares.This is gonna be my first options trade im scaredAll in 15c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80More risk in calls but more reward. If you don't hit your strike price by expiration your investment goes to 0. You could always sell out prior to expiration though. Each option contract gives you control of 100 shares so it's really levering up that initial investment.For options, dip your feet slowly.  Dont spend your while wad prematurely.  Also start with longer expiries as opposed to really short dated ones until you get a better feel for IV, hype, and greeksAlso what do you think about $12c 1/29? Are you gonna put in positions tomorrow at open?Thank you for explaining it to me!!!I'm in the Sept $10 calls. I got it today when the stock was at $9. Hopefully see a good return on this already tomorrow but I'm holding it through. I think this stock has room to run. I think it will hit $12 by 1/29 but you have to see what the premium you're paying on the option is. For example, if you're buying the $12 and paying $2 per contract that means  the stock needs to hit $14 for you to break even. From what I saw earlier today, the premiums on the further out options were cheap for the upside. I got my calls for 2.80. If I was going in for more I'd look at the $15c further out but $12 1/29 may not be bad depending on that premium.  Stocks up big after hours so everything is going to jump tomorrow morning.that's gonna be pretty risky with only about 2 weeks to expiryI\u2019d literally pay you to mentor me.. thank you so much for helping me understand. So if I did $10c  1/29, and since that\u2019s the deeper ITM, the less the stock has to rise in order to break even. Would that be a better/safer call?No, if it's deeper in the money you will have to pay for that. It is embedded in the price of the call. There are several inputs to the price of the call including the share price, the strike price, how volatile people think the stock will be (higher during events like earnings releases), and time until expiration (theta). If you buy a $10c and the stock is $11, there is already $1 of intrinsic value that you have to pay for in addition to paying for the other components. If it's at $11 and you buy an $11c then there is no intrinsic value and you're paying for only the other components. As you move the strike higher from the share price the lower the option will cost just due to the lower probability of reaching it. If you pull up yahoo finance you can look at the options and see how the price changes based on different strokes, expiration dates, etc.  There are also implied volatility calculators out there that can show you what is priced in. When some of these stocks get moving you can see implied volatility of 100%+ which means you're paying a steep premium.", "linkFlairText": "Meme", "totalAwardsReceived": 4, "rating": 6.086089502930485}, {"id": "ky7ggk", "stockTicker": "LMT", "title": "$LMT is going to \ud83d\ude80 to the \ud83c\udf19", "selfText": "1. $LMT is in $ARKQ and Cathie added to the position this week on the same day she bought some in $PLTR\n2. $LMT will (very likely) be in $ARKX as it is one of the biggest players in the Space Industry and they have some of the most experienced talent. \n3.

It was a lot easier before, now Wall Street has their hooks in them.I always thought PLTR was long term. Don\u2019t think it needs pumpingPLTR's market cap is too high.

It\u2019s so frustrating. That\u2019s how I felt though when I was losing a lot on GME, but kept the faith and was rewarded. With PLTR I feel 10x better about them then GME. I foresee daddy Karp memes is WSB\u2019s future.Yoo I got almost the same with 110 at 8,72I made the black guy Palantir because he\u2019s fat, Palantir has a huge market cap.

They are a tank. Slow to move, but almost impossible to take down. Once companies start realizing the potential for using PLTR to make sense/use of their data sets, it\u2019s game over.Square moved slowly at first and dropped to $40 at the lowest during the March pandemic crash. They just closed at $232.Honestly think I\u2019m going to move my 93 shares of PLTR at open tomorrow into some BB for the cultureBlockbuster video is next!$BB this is the wayIf Blackberry wasnt named Blackberry with the stigma behind it, it would be a $20bil company right now. \n\n$50 is my target.10-25B market cap?

Let's imagine you are a big swinging dick hedge fund and you want to buy a ton of shares and ride this thing to the moon. But there's still a ton of shares not available for you to buy yet (feb lockup). Of course you aren't going to let it soar preemptively before you have loaded up. \n\nOnce lockup expires start accumulating your positions in the following days / weeks and hold forever.PLTR is extremely predictable and easy to play. Buy when it hits 23/24, sell at 26/27. It's 10% profit every few weeksBrother, Cathie wood just bought 500K shares, we are going to ValhallaI got my shares about 3-4 weeks ago when it reached $9 and then went to $6 \ud83d\ude05 honestly I think still has future, a guy posted a long and detailed DD about BB this week, you should check it out\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo4ed/looking_for_the_next_rocket_look_no_further_than/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareI have 9 shares of GME \ud83d\ude05 everybody here says that this is just starting, but try to get the best price you can \ud83e\udd20Positions for $BB?ON IT!Same, to go with my other 1240.Just bougth 200 PLTR shares.

Buying PLTR every chance I get.Agreed stop trying to steal our spotlight. Pltr is next but wait for us to finish firstGME made us millionaires, but PLTR will make us billionaires.Tsla has entered the chatLet the boys pump!!!!I mean, it is long term, but I\u2019d sure like a price hike!Yeah but you're talking to WSB here. Long term is EOM OTM calls instead of EOW OTM calls.People should sell long dated puts. you can get almost $9 right now for a november $25. You only tie up like $1k of buying power, absolute worst case you get shares at a $16 cost, if it just sits around and goes no where or goes up you make almost a 100% return on the buying power you tie up.Too real.yes just like $TSLA3/19 $10c checking in2 contracts of the same checking in \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80This guy Jelly ^\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udeecWell done Foreignbrohe's also got the worst moves of the threesource?For sure!!!!!

Bought at $20ish ( i know, late to the game), sold at 25ish today.  Bought Tilray at open, got a nice 20% gain today.  Will dump probably tomorrow and wait for discount on PLTR or maybe hold for twitterThey're like a security company now or something. And signed an automotive deal with a China company to build the self driving software for the car? Something like that. I remember people talking about it back in November but haven't heard anything else about BB till today.Swapped, they are in cybersec, electric cars and software. They also just sold like 70 pattents to Huawei.More buttons = more $$But don\u2019t listen to me because I\u2019m so retarded I can\u2019t even reply on the right commentI say shares if you can afford it. Options to max your leverageConsider it done, il post and dm you tomorrow!Interesting. The 90 patents they sold off was yesterday\u2019s news though, I\u2019m surprised the pop happened today.

I believe 80% of shares will be available for trade after that. Currently I think its only around 20%The day to day prices are different than the big green chart you see. It only reports one price per day when looking at a 3m view, and you don't see the fluctuations that i'm talking aboutDumb question: how are up when it hasn\u2019t hit $10?Same! So I sold some more stuff and bought a Mar $9 and a 2023 $10 callYOLOWhat is their product exactly?Secrets of the trade my friend ;)They don't want us to make money but eventually they will have no choice.Bought 155 (my entire account) sometime this morning, pleas fly againBro, did you even see that sweet 4% AH?What the fuck. What\u2019s your % gain rn bro I need stuff to jerk off toSqueeze me bbyi have apha stocks and calls and the other two... same with BB but with 10 8.5c 1/22 instead... hoping for 20 so i can ring that register.$1500 in $9c expiring on 1/22. Wish me luck boystrust meSame. Ridiculous.Already 20It\u2019ll hit 10 today, 20 next week, then the moon. I\u2019m in @7.40 ;)If BB jumps from $9 today to $20 sometime in the future, that contract for $430 will be worth a lot more (because the underlying asset of BB is more valuable). You could sell to close the contract at any time between now and expiration and take the difference, or, for a call option you could exercise the option at expiration and purchase the 100 shares of BB at whatever strike price you chose. Most people sell the contract before expiration and pocket the profit.Please stop using options till you read some stuff on how it works.And is that good for the stock price? By good I mean \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Lol dude I don't use RH. I'm literally looking at it on Bloomberg I can see intraday pricing just fine, that's still not a pattern that's repeated more than 3 (maybe 4 depending if you have some leeway around your ranges) times. Hardly something I'd call extremely predictable especially when it's a brand new range for the ticker to begin with...Value of a call is (Intrinsic Value) + (Time Value).  Intrinsic Value is 0 until the stock reaches the strike price.  But Time Value is more complicated, it increases as the share price climbs, and decreases (or decays) as time elapses.  So the value of a call option goes up when the stock goes up, even when it is \"out of the money,\" as long as they go up fast enough to beat the time \"decay\".because people are so certain that it will which makes them willing to pay more for that contract.  If it stayed at that price until expiration, the value would go down.I placed an option order this morning before market but it\u2019s not reflected yet? Anybody help me out?Pffft, wouldn\u2019t YOU like to know \ud83d\ude0eDarn I have the perfect meme video for PLTR I just need to get something working for an hour to make it. Will try again tonightThe minute buyden appointed Avril Haines as director of intelligence was the moment I knew I had to go all in[186% today, 28% overall](https://imgur.com/a/ElCBX7u)That\u2019s gonna land way in the money. Did you pick them up cheap?But why?I literally bought them just after open too for $1.02. Should have stayed at the doctor incase my erection lasts longer than 4 hours.In at 9.10 lets get it.Thank you for explaining this moreAnd the option holder would get $100 for every dollar above their strike price? Ex. $9 contract goes to $20 430 goes to 1530?I mean you're right, i've done it 4 times. But 10% per month is a pretty great return is it not? AMD and Netflix used to do the same way back when, as did TSLA.the time value of GME calls this afternoon was PEAK MONEY.This is probably one of the most concise and well put ways to explain this that I've seen.So the contract itself is fluctuating? As well as the stock? I so so dumbWell well well... I somehow missed that in my DD.\n\nGood lookin out!Yeah like $0.50/contract. \n\nI\u2019m rock hard rn looking at these AH numbers\n\nI also have GME calls that are about to print lolYou wanted a DD not a god damn philosophyI wanted to buy 20c for next year, option was not there.emptied my load at 8.53 lets take it all!!!Option have a value called delta. It determines how the option price changes with regard to the stock. For strikes near the current price(ATM: At The Money) , it's usually about 0.5 meaning for every dollar the stock goes up the option goes up $0.5.\n\nThe lower the strike, the higher the delta.The contract value will vary with time and stock price. It's not a direct 1:1 ratio.Sure I'm not saying that's not a great return, just that thinking it is \"extremely predictable\" when it's only held the range a month and a half is setting you up for heartbreak. I trade ranges on FX which are wayyyyy more stable, and still managed to get burned and lose a few months of profit being the wrong way (and trying to buy the dip) through March when USD rallied hard. And have missed out on some fantastic gains when a huge rally occurs after selling at my PT. Which again, is fine, as long as you know that's how you're playing the stock. You just have to be ok with missing out on the gains in a sustained one way rally...Because changing your mind and FOMO'ing in is usually one of the worst things you can do (unless it's TSLA).exactly, the contract price is fluidYeah which is why some people can make profits on super OTM options when the stock never even gets close to the strike price but is heading in that directionFuck yeah. I missed the GME rocket ship but I\u2019m strapped in for BB (relative to being the poor that I am, anyway).I bought 1000 shares too because my old man still uses a blackberry.I ended up not pulling the trigger on 3/19 $10c. It was in my price range and I just didn\u2019t do it! Regretting it today after chasing like an idiot. I am so close to doing this right\n\nGuess I\u2019ve got til March for it to come back a little.I guess that\u2019s where I\u2019m stuck. I understand that the contracts fluctuates, but how does the stock price effect it?Fair. I hope you're having a nice Thursday my guyGME this week was fun, but the real win for me was actually a 300% play on Tilray calls. I\u2019ve rolled the profits from that into some more later dated Tilray calls and *those* are printing too (and that\u2019s before the opt price reflects this AH fun)\n\nMy account is up like 26% this week. It\u2019s been a good weekLol amazing.\n\nMy only regret if not buying enoughhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\u2013Scholes_equation\n\nOption price varies based on a number of variables. \n\nYou are partially correct however\u2014***at expiry*** the option\u2019s value is equal to (share price-strike price) x $100 (if it\u2019s a call)That's where the greeks come into play, my man. The delta of an option determines how much the price of the contract fluctuates as the underlying stock value moves.As the other redditors have explained there are many factors at play which determine a contract's price. I'd simply reiterate that the stock price is one underlying value which directly affects your option contact's value. \n\nFor example:\nIf I sell you an option to buy a bar of gold today for $1,000 and the price of a gold bar is also $1,000, then your option is not worth anything (because you can buy the gold bar in the market for the same price I'm giving you the option for). However, if tomorrow, the price of a bar of gold is $1,200, all of a sudden the option I sold you to buy the bar of gold for $1,000 has a higher worth. Most people would sell the option to buy the gold and pocket the profit before the option expires (in case the price of gold bars drops below $1,000 tomorrow). Other people might exercise their option at expiration, and hope that gold is worth more than $1,000 (so they can sell it for a profit or hold on to it long term, if that's their goal).\n\nJust replace \"gold bar\" with \"stock option\" in the example above and that's the general idea.\n\nI didn't realize that most people don't hold options all the way until expiration and instead sell them for a profit until I started trading options. That was a big learning point for me, personally.Now kiss.Can't complain, 4pm and I'm about to crack open a few bottles for a late Zoom Christmas party for work...cheers bud.That\u2019s everyone\u2019s regret when something \ud83d\ude80 to the moon**[Black\u2013Scholes equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\u2013Scholes equation)**\n\nIn mathematical finance, the Black\u2013Scholes equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the price evolution of a European call or European put under the Black\u2013Scholes model. Broadly speaking, the term may refer to a similar PDE that can be derived for a variety of options, or more generally, derivatives. For a European call or put on an underlying stock paying no dividends, the equation is:                                \u2202        V                     \u2202        t                     +                 1       2                    \u03c3            2                    S            2                                           \u2202                  2                        V                     \u2202                S                  2                                     +     r     S                        \u2202        V                     \u2202        S                     \u2212     r     V     =     0         {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial t}}+{\\frac {1}{2}}\\sigma ^{2}S^{2}{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}V}{\\partial S^{2}}}+rS{\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial S}}-rV=0}  where V is the price of the option as a function of stock price S and time t, r is the risk-free interest rate, and             \u03c3         {\\displaystyle \\sigma }  is the volatility of the stock. The key financial insight behind the equation is that, under the model assumption of a frictionless market, one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \u201celiminate risk\".\n\n[^(About Me)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) ^- [^(Opt out)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) ^(- OP can reply !delete to delete) ^- [^(Article of the day)](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

Of course gme will hit $500/share end of year, but for all other semi-retarded autist, lemme tell you why you should be buying $bbby right now before close. \n\n- Very well regarded Mark Tritton (former Target CMO) became a CEO just over a year ago. He\u2019s the only the 3rd CEO and 1st outsider in the company\u2019s history who\u2019s very optimistic about a turnaround\n\n- they\u2019ve sold non-core assets and expect to raise additional $350mm-$450mm in cash from non-core that will be pushed towards digital sales\n\n- Digital Comps up 94% YoY. Penetration online continues to grow drastically with a 31% annual growth rate\n\n- More digital means wider margins. Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. \n\n- They\u2019ve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That\u2019s 1/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management \n\n- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. \n\n- EV/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post. So that alone should put us at a fair value of $35/share today. Based on forward EBITDA for 2021, that\u2019s $39/share in the next 12 months. And that\u2019s not accounting for share buyback.\n\n\nSounds good right. But wait, there\u2019s more\n\n\n-BBBY is the 5th most shorted stock over $1 billion MC with 68% of short float. You all know #1, the other 3 are garbage. Just like u/runrun8 pointed, Michael Burry is in, and YES, the fucking Melvin has the audacity to short this one too. \n\n-Our king retard Cramer is pushing it (by frequently interviewing the CEO and explicitly saying that $BBBY is the next squeeze)\n\nTLDR: 2000 shares + May 2021 $30 Calls \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 (Second time in my life I go ALL IN.

See ya there space cowboy!you jinxed it.ProofTrue and long term tax as wellHow come?What would the difference be if you did $12 1/29 callAny recommendations on what calls to get when the market opens tomorrow? I was thinking $12c 1/29Pick up the phone start dialing and just be yourself!This shit\u2019s dropping, I got 200 at 9.13Is this a better idea or 1/29 $12? I don\u2019t understand how it really works this will be my first options buy. Also I\u2019m talking about for tomorrow, which one would be better?So how\u2019s this work exactly?\n\nYou\u2019re betting that by February 19th the stock will reach $14. And if you\u2019re right you have the right but not the obligation to sell your shares or something?What position?Both are goodProfit on a call is unlimited, profit on a put is limited by the fact the stock can't go lower than zero. There is some after hours things you can do but its limited.are you meomg I found my people.No one knows how to do anything here, retardOnly some brokers allow it and only after you make a special request.  \n\nBut don't worry,  you can buy shares now and strap on for the ride.Beware of the options!I bought an option once. Cost me $140.\nThats the whole story.I had 4 options for $12.5 and I sold them all at close today. Made a ton of money but I could\u2019ve made moreSo $75?What is BB? Doesn\u2019t matter. Those are my initials. It\u2019s a sign.This killed me when I was trying to buy more GME, had money waiting to go in but due to the holidays(banks closed) it took a while. Couldn\u2019t buy more at the dip when it was around $14, by the time my money was in it was $17.

All we gotta do is pick the next meme stock and here we go :)Should I do $10c 3/19 when the market opens tomorrow? I\u2019m think of doing that, it\u2019s gonna be my first options buyWhen you say 10$ calls does that include the premium or that\u2019s just the strike priceStocks can go down, Stonks only go up\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80>\tAlso BB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThis is the most important point.Widely considered some of the most secure endpoint technology (mostly in vehicle computers) on the market - with self driving/more computerized cars on the horizon those things need to be hyper secure. Plus Canada. Plus recognized name.\"making stuff\"I know it\u2019s a month old, but it gives a little more context other than because r/wallstreetbets posting rockets.\nBut just in case: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I\u2019m going to watch it for a little bit, might buy more calls if it looks like a longer term trend, I think it will though, next GME! \ud83d\ude80Yeah my calls are dropping, I\u2019m hoping tomorrow it will bounce up again.I wondering if I should sell my 9$ callsI NEED TO KNOWSooo, 20-never?I think I'll stick with shares for now until I do some more research!Would you recommend I buy $7c 3/19 tomorrow or $12 1/29I\u2019m dumb and trying to be less dumb. Why buy at $7? Isn\u2019t it at 10? I\u2019m missing this crucial part!\n\nYou answered this in a later post never mind. Thank you!New here. Why a $7 call when it's at 9~ currently unless you expect it to go down? Eli5?\n\nI made a 15c for 1/22 because I have no money and I had the funds in my accountI would honestly buy straddles if you gonna play. BB has been giving up gains every pop. I\u2019m super long term on blackberry 370 shares and 3 7C\u2019s 2023(I have a small account). Premiums are gonna be al types of fucked. Wait for the eventually dip and get in long. Let IV chillWhat date did you set it for?It\u2019s not better or worse, it was just a cheap premium and I\u2019m optimistic for the stock to take off. 1/29 $12c is perfectly fine if you\u2019re looking for a shorter term play, seems fine to me if the premium allows you to buy the volume you wantit's a call, not a put.\n\nyou're buying a contract to purchase 100 shares of $BB for $14/share on or before 2/19. So if it goes over $14, you make money. Let's say it's $15, you exercise the option and buy those 100 shares for $14, so you're automatically up $100.\n\nWhat happens more often though is that people buy and sell just the contracts without necessarily exercising them. So like I buy a contract for 1/15 9c and I pay $0.27/share ($27 total price for the contract), then the stock goes up and suddenly the ability to buy shares at $9/ea becomes more desirable so the price goes up and now that same contract is worth $0.54/share, or $54. \n\nso to somebody who has the capital to exercise it, they see that the stock price is currently $9.60/share, which would be $960/100 shares, or they can buy my contract for $54 and buy 100 shares for $9 per the contract = total price for them comes to $954.Nah, 14 is the strike price, depending on his premium it might have to reach 15+ to break even. He won't buy the shares., instead he'll just sell the option so some other retard will buy it.All of them.Thanks for the info!We are all the same.That was all my parents would let me borrow. \ud83d\ude02BB is \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yea that\u2019s not bad at all, such a bad time to make a deposit on my part before a weekend lolAll in on 1/15 20c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ive been in since 2018....get me back to green boys. 300 at $13.01 and still have room to avg down lolBut what happens if it goes wrong?\u201cTits up\u201d is sooooo fucking funny.

If you bought 1 contract and it failed to hit strike price, do you now owe the cost of 100 shares of the stock, or have you just lost the max price?Bro, 3k savings from last few months all in. I don't got knee surgery but hey \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 rightAlso has to be small enough, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, we\u2019re not influencing Amazon, but we can influence small and mid cap stocks... and Tesla for some reason..Yeah, of course it'll give it plenty of time to get wayyy above the breakeven.\n\nRemindMe! March 19, 2021Strike price. I paid an avg of $0.90 for each so I've already made money.Context<\ud83d\ude80It also went up on that news and then went down right after even after good earnings.\n\nI'd love to know the real reason it spiked besides everyone happened to remember the whole amazon thing.Nah bro that shit is gonna print.you got itYou still might profit, but generally buying OTM calls with a short expiry is very stupid. Its always safe to just buy slightly ITM calls for a bit longer period out7c is too far ITM for how far it moved after hours. Something like a 2/19 9c wouldnt be bad. But dont wait much longer after market open because its going to moon.Because the deeper ITM you are, the less the stock has to rise in order to break even. Since you are so far out OTM on short expiry, you\u2019re more likely to lose your money. But this is a meme stock so it has crazy growth, who knows.So essentially they\u2019d either spend $960 for 100 shares of a stock at $9.60 OR they spend $954 for 100 shares at $9 right?\n\nThe latter being the obvious choice because they not only pay less but they\u2019re getting the stock at a discount. \n\nAm I understanding right?This is the type of comment I\u2019ve been looking for, THANK YOU!Now is the time to learn. I rarely do options (FD\u2019s) and I\u2019m all-in here. Now you can be like the GME autists.My moms boyfriend said not to gamble the money.

GME seemed weird, but it made a lot of sense if you informed yourself properly. BB is just some wanna-be stock imo. Could be entirely wrong thoughIt fucked me today and I\u2019m not proud of it. Red is bad, apparently.When you sell a $16 covered call back in November... That's how you get Fed on PLUG.He\u2019s probably riding the short busMan I\u2019d go yolo it and then it would tank. I should\u2019ve gotten in a couple days ago for the fresh tendies. Imma stick with BB.I\u2019m the original autist.Thank you, you guys are awesome. Much love!I\u2019m in for $10k, let\u2019s go \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Doneor maybe 3 used models?Current M3 is superior in every way so you need to wait until after the refresh anyway.So are we anticipating BB to moon now or???Ok. Lesson learnt.are you fucking stupid WSB absolutely caused the squeeze. We owned like 20% of the shares.Is the GME train done for?I'll bet my kids future on the memeability of this one.BB is also easy to spell which is a real plus.Been awhile since I hopped on a meme so goddammit I'm in.  AH stonks and callz tomorrow.Soon9/17 $9C and I\u2019m in the money after only 7 days with 8 months before expiry and no idea what to do with calls that far away6/18/21 $15 call. Up 265% today. 40 contracts, finally in the green today. Up about $1600Bought the 10 and 12.5 back in Aug... up 600%+ and 400%+ since. \n\nBe wary, it pulls back over time but the news is buzzzzzzzzzinYou are stupid, but probably more confused than stupid.\n\nLEAPs work just like any other option, they're just a year+ out.\n\nThe nice thing about them is they derive a large part of their value from time, so they stay worth a lot of money even if price goes against you.\n\nthey have a strike price just like any other option and if the strike price is below current price, you are ITM on a call and OTM on a put. Just like any other option.Calls or sharesOnly conference I found on BB's press release site is at 1:15 pm EST: \n\n[Needham\u2019s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference](https://wsw.com/webcast/needham103/bb/1838040)  \nFriday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15pm ET  \nRyan Permeh, BlackBerry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, BlackBerry Chief Product Architect in virtual conversation with Richard Valera, Needham & CoI think it\u2019s at 1:15pm ET. It\u2019s their Annual Virtual Growth Conference.30 here lol1:15 ET iirc...You will most likely want to get in early and fast.

Sold bc it wasn't moving fast enough. Oops.People were talking about BB far before that, you\u2019re the one needing to catch on you autistLeaps?Where do you go for solid leap DD?Was joking. Entered in when options were trading ~0.10LeverageFor the most part people do not exercise their options, even if they are far in the money. They usually get sold before expiration, or expire worthless if you made a bad bet.You can resell the option contract and keep all the profit from the stock value increase. (without buying stock)100 shares is $900. But 10 contracts at .90 each is 1000 shares for $900. So much more profit/loss potential for the same price for those who are lower on capitalYou can make way more buying options than shares. If you buy 100 shares at $9 and he sells at $18 he's only making $900 in profit. And that's assuming the price doubles. \n\nMeanwhile he could buy options for February or March for a $10 or $15 strike and make significantly more than $900.

Also tradestation and interactive brokers, but aprooval takes a few days.Interactive brokers or tastyworksYou won't be able to trade options in the UK, however you can trade CFDs or spread bets which both allow you to leverage you money.

See you on the bright side of the Moon! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80What call should I make for tomorrow? Do I buy one set to expire tomorrow?I think you're lost, r/investing is -> that way.Appreciate your advice, I think I'm mostly in that position now, I have about 20k available to get started, I've put 4k into SPY for long term and I've been using 1k to learn the ropes which is what I've split up between these shares and some others, not going to commit any of the rest until I learn more and get some hands on time.I bought 1 call cause why not. Dumped the rest in shares. Retards to the endI literally opened my trading account like 3 days ago and all this is new to me. I was told options are complicated so it kinda scared me away. I bought a 2/5 $11 call @$1.06 just to see what happens tomorrow. Hope this works out.how is that percentage calculated? What did you pay for the call and what's the target? \ncan you explain to me: options are shares make the same amount of money or not? \n\nlet's say the stock is $10, and you have $20 call. \n\n* you buy 100 shares for $10 (-$1k) and sell for $20 (+$2k) you made $1k profit\n\n* you buy a $20 call for $X (idk how much, but i assume not much, say -$100). Then you exercise the call to get 100 shares, you pay -$900 ( $10*100 - what you already paid, correct?) and sell for +$2k). It's the same $1k profit right? \n\nSo the percentage you listed is the difference between call cost ($100) and net profit ($1000)?? So in this example it's 900%?At what strike and premium?Exactly what I told myself \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80for once im glad I didn't inverse OP. good call my guy9.50 1/22 checking inMe too. I bought 10 contracts for 10c expiring tomorrow. First time doing this.\n\n\nShould I sell them before or after the conference?Dang bro.

Had to make two 911 emergency phone calls in life or death situations then. Both times someone died. In one of those situations the victim could have been saved if they could have gotten there seconds sooner. But.. Both times the emergency call dropped. Fucking dropped! Just like their \ud83d\ude80. Through the investigations they found that the call dropping was 100% the devices fault. I found out then that they were notorious for dropped calls and very quickly bought a differant brand phone. When I told one of my engineer friends over at Black Berry this, he confirmed to me it was a known issue. He is now one of the department heads.. Love the guy.. But yah.. Fucked up..Screw it sold some T and bought 22 more of the same. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I heard they were gonna discuss some things Friday so I believe there isNews tomorrow according to post, sell tomorrowI thought about it but have everything locked up.

That shit is dynamite baby.I have the option to buy 6600 shares for the premium of 10k because I have 66 contracts. Most people don't actually take the shares, they just sell the contract at a higher priceFor selling a call option, are you only exchanging the premium? Do the stocks themselves ever change hands?

Expected console sales were already priced in. It's not like the console release was a surprise that came out of nowhere. It's pretty well known gme didn't get many given to their stores too. That exact number won't even be released till April. \n\nThe short squeeze hasn't even happened yet either. \n\nThe only big catalyst is Cohen and the two other chief executives joining leadership to rebuild gme's business model.Covid will probably last another year at least.Im pretty sure from a reliable source that the bankruptcy will be inevitable this year.How?  Sell the original and buy more?  Why would that be more beneficial than hanging on to the original that was purchased at a lower premium?I\u2019m a bit worried this is going to be a palantir redux where it rises fast, but the. it\u2019s stagnant for a long time, and a better use of capital would be to sell one or two contracts to invest somewhere else that\u2019s on the verge of busting through.You should buy shares. \n\nA call is where you\u2019re buying the rights to 100 shares and basically you\u2019re gambling on the possibility it will go up to a certain amount by a certain date. Rocket potential upside and catastrophic potential downside (if it doesn\u2019t reach what you predicted it would, you lose 100% of it, and it goes down quickly if you guess wrong). Also, once the rocket has initiated liftoff, you e pretty much missed the possibility of making a profit on calls. \n\nTLDR: buy shares until you\u2019re ready to go full R.Calls are bets that the stock will go up in the future and give you a right to buy 100 at a certain price (or you can sell the contract)Only one rocket emoji is terrible. Time to buy puts!DD?Sadly you can\u2019t trade options on Etoro (neither Revolut, which - as a Europoor - I\u2019m using. Thinking about switching to Interactive Brokers).\nBefore you get into options trading, definitely watch videos / read about it first. It\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 casino: it can give way higher returns than just owning a share, also zou can easily lose all your money (see posts flaired as \u201cLoss\u201d, aka lossporn).\n\nAlso welcome to WSB, happy trading and fuck you in advance for your gainz to come ;).Hmmm strange I just checked and its there for me. Next to \"discover\"If you go back to the trade options page, to the left of the dates you should see a tab that says \"Discover\"\n\n\nI recommend clicking that and reading through the Robinhood info they provide on that page and then watching a few Youtube videos.\n\n\nI've read countless reddit posts/comments about options trading but what really helped me was seeing others do it via a video and then making some low risk ones myself.Hell ya!! Quick question you may know. I bought calls after market for .83 cents. Will they now not go through bc the post market? I\u2019m an idiot!!!No shit, retard.The guy who sold it to you is hoping that it expires worthless, so no stock ever has to change hands. And the vast majority of people buying calls are not doing so with the hopes of obtaining 100 shares of a stock, but rather to have that contract itself rise in value so they can sell the contract for a profit. But once it's been created, that option basically goes into a pool of options at the same strike and expiration, so sellers aren't under contract with a particular person, but more just the market itself.\n\nAt least that's how I think about it in my limited understanding, I'm far from an expert, having just started this hobby of messing with options after Fantasy Football season ended. I'd recommend checking out some basic options tutorial type videos on youtube if you've got a little time, the basics can be grasped fairly easily IMO.Check out https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/\n\nIf you really want to learn and you use Robinhood, this video is as good as it gets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms\n\nYou should really be thinking of options as just that, options. You are paying a **premium** to buy a **contract** which gives you the option to **buy 100 shares** at the desired **strike price** anytime from now until the **expiration date**. You can **exercise** this option at anytime, or you can sell the contract back for a profit/loss.\n\nBut yes, it's essentially a \"bet.\" I think that video explains all you need to know. Watch it in chunks so you don't overwhelm yourself.Yes[https://tastyworks.com/](https://tastyworks.com/) accepts europeansHow much were they this morning?You've never heard of Van Guh?It means Out of The Money, aka higher than the current price.ITM - inside the money\n\nATM - at the money\n\nOTM outside the money. unless its BB then everything will be money come  \ud83d\ude80 Friday \ud83d\ude80Thank you.

So OTM PUTS?My sources have told me GameStop inc. is done and not just on twitch.The farther OTM an option is, the more money it makes moving closer to ITM.\n\nThe closer the expiry, the more money it makes as it moves closer to ITM.\n\nTake profits from a conservative leap that printed early and roll them into a closer expiry or a farther OTM or both. \n\nIts definitely an increase in risk in exchange for a larger profit %.\n\nEdit: If IV has changed drastically, maybe hold onto the original?

No you\u2019ll need to readjust at open for a higher price. Since it mooned after close today the options prices you see currently won\u2019t fill.Trying some covered calls with BB let\u2019s see how that goes.If the stock rises to make the option valuable, why would someone *ever* sell it? Wouldn't they get a significantly better margin just executing and instantly selling the shares? Maybe they think the stock won't rise enough and try to sell it to someone who thinks it will. But that's it, really.\n\nIf you aren't buying the option to hold the shares, I guess the only reason to sell it is the edge case that you fail to believe in it anymore and want to reap back some of the premium you paid. Maybe?Just ordered a 12 dollar call expiring jan 29th. It still needs time to execute. Good call or nah?Nice video. I'm not a retard like you guys but extra knowledge never hurt. And who knows, maybe in a year or two I'll have some side cash I can yolo on the next GME...$0.53 this morning. I sold them at $1.50. But then I decided to go back in with 5 1/22 12CIf you can guess the market right, and you're not getting screwed by the market, yes.  Absolutely.  Hands down, 1000%.\n\nBut on average you're not right.  You're going to get it wrong.  You will lose these calls.  Look at the loss porn.  Study them.  Those are calls.  If they bought shares and just held and moved on with their lives they'd be fine.\n\nThe honest most accurate call- and this is the most boring answer- is to have time in the market and to not to try to time the market.\n\nJust buy some shares in something you think works, or you have a hunch on, and forget about them till a few years later or when the market rallies on something and you think you need to make a move.   And just keep piling on new shares, market up or down.  It adds up.The option gives him the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares for $15 each. That means that if the share price is $15.01 the option contract is worth 1 dollar, because he can buy the shares for $15.00 and sell them for 15.01 for a profit of 0.01 x 100 shares. At a share price of $16 the contract is worth 100 dollars. Basically, for every penny it\u2019s over 15, he makes a dollar.If the share price is $15 or below, the contract is worth 0 because its cheaper to buy the shares on the market than to buy them for $15 dollars each. He then is out the money he paid for the contract.\n\nAll these amounts are based on the share price at the day of expiration. If it hits the $15-mark before that it is worth more because of the time left componentThe short of it is; Most people sell the contract (particularly here) to someone else on the market just like you would sell a stock.  If the stock is worth more than the options are worth he /she makes a lot of money.  If not, the contract is worthless and he/she probably lost the contract fees and commission (typically they let the contract expire by the date listed).\n\nThe difference between the stock and the stock option is the stock has equity.  You get to keep the stock even if it falls in value and you can always sell at a later date.  The stock option becomes worthless after the expiration date, plus you pay a premium just to have it.  Stock options are risky, with huge pay offs if you can guess the market direction.\n\nThere are bigger plays to considered with options as well.  Such as exercising the stock option even if the stock option is below market value (maybe you think its going to be worth more in the near future?).   But this is something you need to consider with some legit due diligence because a lot of actual retardation gets floated around here.\n\nIf you want to throw some money in the pot, just buy a few shares.  Can't go wrong with building the equity.I recommend Ben Felix on YouTube.

GME and BBBY it is.truuuuuee, Ride or Diejust try itWe won't know for sure until the January 31st when we get the report update. The recent surge is due more to Ryan Cohen stepping in with two others in my opinion. With the amount of shorts out there I think that the actual squeeze will be more drastic. I could be wrong though.Because the short volume is up, not down, so it hasn't started.They just gained $300 million today.  They can last out a few more months.  Realistically you only have until now people support ending lockdowns than enforcing them. Thats going to be within the next 2 months.Bless your heart.  I can but you shouldn\u2019tYes, but you have to tell them you know what you\u2019re doing. Someone on this thread explained the button steps to me since I couldn\u2019t figure it out some time back. In five weeks, I lost about 25%.  That being said, calls also made me about 20% today, so they are a fickle mistress.  I can\u2019t tell you the button presses to do it because I don\u2019t remember them.https://youtu.be/1Y3FzVQi-R8\n\nI\u2019m bold enough to gamble all of my money, but with the internets memory and growing databases, I\u2019m not bold enough to put the word in writing on a website.Oops, my mistakeCertified autist here. At the moment BB calls at a strike price are 1.13 for 10c expiring 1/29. Do I lose the 113 dollar premium when I sell it or is that part of the value?You can either exercise your call and buy those shares or (as most people on here do) sell the contract for a profitBecause in order to execute that option, you have to actually have the money to purchase those stocks, which most autistics retards here, do not, so they sell the option under the total value such that someone else will buy and exercise the contract.\n\nThe reason why you would want to buy options instead of stocks is that you can buy \"the right\" to buy a LOT more stocks vs if you just bought stocks in the first place, giving you a lot more return when you sell that option.Let me just give you a quick example. I bought my first option a couple weeks ago, a 1/29 $12c of Tilray for .38 premium (per share, so $38 total). A few days later Tilray was already over $12 and the option was worth >$100. I sold it, and basically got 150% return. However, that very same option is now trading for over $6.50 premium the last time I checked. That $500+ that I missed out on is the whole point of purchasing that option in the first place.\n\nThat's a simple example but I think shows how my intention was never to own 100 shares of Tilray, despite being bullish on it. I get to collect the rise in price for 100 shares for significantly less money than if I'd purchased 100 shares of Tilray at the time I bought that option when it was trading at about $9.50. Options can give you significantly more leverage, however are much riskier than shares at the same time. If Tilray had tanked, I would have lost my $38 if it expired worthless.Adding one thing here: \n\nThe further a call is from an expiration date, the more time value it has (eg. there's more time for the stock price to rise even more), which factors into the option price too.\n\nSo if your call has shot up in value, then waiting until expiration might lose you $ if the stock price plateaus, as there will be time value decay. \n\nI'm also rtrd when it comes to this but pretty sure this is trueSo that will breakeven at $12.10, so if you're thinking it will get to $12.10 by Jan 29, it's a good call! I would sell about a week or so before expiry if you're up on your position because each day you suffer theta decay (look this up).Start small. Remember with buying calls, the most you can lose is what you put in.Thanks. I'm learning a lot today and getting a good idea how these work. Is it normally better to sell the option once value increases, or exercise then sell the stocks?Thanks a lot for the reply, I didn\u2019t know much about options and this helped me get a grasp on it. So your option of $12.50 on Feb 12 is pretty solid since it\u2019s already at 9.40-ish, right?I'm new to this as well. I was wondering what happens if you sell an option without actually buying it first? Do you then essentially owe whoever bought the contract 100 shares if they exercise the option?Buy high, sell higher you'll still do okPreach. GL in the trenches brothe circle-jerk or BB?Isn't there an update tomorrow?Interesting. Appreciate the response\ud83d\udc99I didnt have much trouble with it, just clicked the button for \"some experience\" and it allowed me to lose money on the stock market in a whole new way!Heh thats rookie numbers i opened an options account last February. Had no clue what i was doing. Down 99% in a month or two. Climbing my way back upOh ok. Thank you btw for defining shares and calls. If I get started on the market I will probably just buy shares xDCertified dumbass here but I will try to help.\n\nFor an options contract you will need to pay the premium. In this case the BB calls are $113 for ONE contract which controls 100 shares.\n\nTMR if the premium rises to 1.23 from 1.13 (113 to 123) and you sell the contract you will get $123. Either way you lose the premium money. It's a matter of making enough money to cover the premium.I thought I read somewhere that Brokers will let you execute and sell instantly? What is the process/option for that? I just opened a TD Ameritrade a little while ago. Wouldn't that be fine by them, especially if they could charge a fee/commission?What stopped you from just waiting and executing? Was selling the option worth more than the 100x(price-12)? I'd figure you'd want to wait to be sure where the peak was and execute on the downslide, as long as it's still above what you spent on the stocks.I guess the math can favor the options selling within a certain risk margin. \n\n\"The option *has* to go up by X more before executing is worth more than the premium now, but if I wait and sell the option later after the stock plateaus, the premiums I'll get will be lower.\"\n\nThis is territory where I can understand the principal a lot faster than I can just do the math in my head. I'm guessing there are calculators or sites people use for this.Very rarely would you want to exercise the option in this case.  Usually people sell.   It\u2019s a more advanced long term play to consider exercising the option if you have the capital and the consideration for the equity appreciating long term - couple of years typically.Nah, it's actually super aggressive.  I'd aim for something more conservative if I did it again.  I mean, what on earth does BLACKBERRY have in store that justifies a near 30% gain in a month.  So 9.4-10ish is a good call.\n\n But the rest of my spreads in steel are doing fine so... \ud83d\ude80You sell the contract on the market to someone else.  That other person then exercises the options.  It's no longer you're issue to deal with.  Typically its a larger firm that's exercising the option to buy the stock.  But that's between them.If tits up just turn the screen upside down to red rocket to the moonyupPuts expire tomorrow I believeYou\u2019re welcome man. Ask around.

So I\u2019d need BB (currently at 10.4) to rise to 11 to be in the money. Anything above that and I I\u2019d be on the moon? \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Just learning, wanted to lock in profits and weed stocks are very volatile, thought it could be a temporary bump rather than what it now appears to be, a stepping stone on the way to the moon. Obviously I am regretful now and feel like I've learned a valuable lesson, but hindsight is always 20/20 and profit is profit.> What stopped you from just waiting and executing?\n\nThe chance that the stock price drops.Ideally sure. But that's trying to time the market, and being risky instead of locking in profits.Awesome thank you!Thank you so much. So as long as I buy the option and then sell it on the market I can make my tendies and no longer have to worry about that contract again.Kek, too bad im still underage so i'm just doing virtual trading on etoro. So i'm with you guys xd (i just started yesterday)Essentially yeah. But you gotta remember that a contract declines in value every single day. I'm looking at the contract right now, and since its a new one if it increased to like 10.7 tomorrow you will already make some money.\n\nI wish you good luck my man! Make that shit print and kick your wife's bf out of your house.Correct.  Just sell it (most likely) or exercise it before the expiration.Honestly, I think everyone should do that to start and learn before time is up.Yea way too broke to exercise that shit.

If I just listened to the autists I would have doubled my money on market orders alone.Hold strong, GME holders. Shorts were sweating at $25. Now at >$36 they're completely fucked.

House call if they dip below 35% and an immediate exchange call at 25% equity. They might be able to stretch it out but they will have to sell something to cover or bring in more trendies.I don't own any GME but these meme are something else\ud83d\ude02My favorite movie and scene of all time.yo i bought at 38 does that mean 0% for me then??GME gang welcomes every bagholder \ud83d\udcbcShould i go in with a leverage x2 maybe just to get as many shares as possible?Wait, is Melvin winning? What is going on? Retreat?We're all selling at open and using the gains for more PLTR?First of all it's Macedonians in English and Makedones in Greek(-lish). Makedonians doesn't exist.\n\nThey were considered savages by the Athenians just like the Athenians were considered boy lovers by the Spartans. City states weren't in the best of terms at the time and political rivalry between them doesn't change their ethnic composition. Theyre all descendants of the same tribes give or take, speak the same language and believe in the same cultural traditions.\n\nMoreover, Philip was actually from Argos.May I ask why are people doing this considering all the news around game stop and where the company is actually headingCan you make a part 2 of this meme where that paper hand cripple ass mf leads the Persians behind the Spartans? Cause that's going down rnIs someone gonna post the scene after this?Y\u2019all know how this movie ends right?I mean I like it but you do know how that movie ended right?Lol don\u2019t they all die in the end?I finally bought in.

Seems the whole point is to lead this sub off of cliffs. The short term gains are glorious but I can\u2019t see any future this stock doesn\u2019t crash after the artificial bubble pops. I like your style tho. That shit is cute.Can someone explain what happened here? Why is it up 100% in 2 days?Don\u2019t... don\u2019t the Spartans lose at the end \ud83e\udd7aUmmm, doesn't this end bad for us?Someone explain I'm stupidDon't we all die at the end tho...FUCK MELVIN GME YOLO GANG\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ugh!

He told the tale1. You get a broker. Fund your account. If you're only using \"a few quid,\" then you'll want a discount broker like Robinhood. (Not sure what's available in the UK.)\n2. If you want to get involved in \"this sort of thing\" (i.e., what WSB does), just pick stocks you think will shoot up and buy some short-term call options. You need an options account to do that. Basically, you'll want to figure out how to calculate the leverage of positions you're considering (\\[delta \\* stock price\\] / call price). More is better if you think it will shoot up.\n3.

Do you own workShhhhh don\u2019t use that word it\u2019s just about memes rememberIt\u2019s a meme to buy GME, not manipulation jeez, that\u2019s boomer talk we millennials and Gen z up in this shitNo, this is using the rules of the game against the elite who used sketchy mechanisms to sell more of something than actually existed to screw over average investors.  They sold more GME shares than they could technically own.  One of ours saw a cheap company and is making something good out of it and we are in it because it makes more sense to us than the garbage reports Citron or Hindenberg put out.  Those guys are market manipulators.No.  \u201cSqueezing\u201d an over sold short actually brings the stock to a more fair market balance. \n\n\nSelling more shares of a company than the number of shares that exist is potentially manipulation and does not help the market come to a fair valuation.  \n\n\nThe argument is that they essentially diluted the fair market value by over selling the shares.  \n\n\nSo, it\u2019s a free market righting itself, by saying \u201coh if those are worth $x diluted, then when the dilution is removed they should be worth more\u201d.  It\u2019s math. It\u2019s free market.  \n\n\nTo stop that, or regulate buying over shorted stocks, would be diminishing the free market.  Which is the opposite goal of financial regulation.Its quite literally notStrictly speaking\n\nProbablySomeone said that Melvin Capital increased their short position[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)  \n\n\napparently this is delayed 20 mins.

Although that battleship one slipped into one of my all time favorites.How long of a call do you recommend?Thanks for the information! How far out do you recommend I buy the call?Extremely, last I checked everyone was laughing at those who grasped to their GME stonksSo that your broker cannot lend your shares for shorting without your permission.

Us seeing an overextended fund, engaged with an even shadier insitutions behind them, capitalizing on them is not illegal.  That's savvy.\n\nWhen stated institutions are *naked short selling* shares that *don't exist*, sir, that is illegal.  Of course, its already been mathematically proven beyond a reasonable doubt that is exactly what they were doing, so, at that point, they squeezed the shit out of themselves.  *Of course* they were going to get long squeezed by the same autistic retards as well.  Why the hell not?  Those options were juicy as shit.  Unlike them, the people selling those calls *are covered by shares and/or cash*.  The callers don't have to borrow anything.  So you can see a scenario, where someone like me, whom sees a situation where I can literally make 10% return *of my entire portfolio* in two god damned days *with little to no risk* who has a fuckton of capital selling .  Well, you can see where those call sellers are coming from.  Besides the shorts pathetically to unload -20k puts in a way that doesn't get them prosecuted/bankrupt, you got us, the *savvy* ones gobbling up literal *tens of thousands of shares* to turnaround.\n\nThat all adds up to a squeeze.  That is simple market dynamics.  But, the important part, is *who was doing the illegal thing that led to perversion that led to this situation*.  That sir, is the insitutions who were naked short selling.  Feel free to report 'em to the SEC.  Most of us already did.... how dumb can a company be?  They are facing off against not only 1.8m autist, but also any trading firm that secretly watches us from the  shadows.So I think that means somebody was selling calls (another way to short a stock), but seemingly bought up the volume to close that position out (this demand spiked the price). Basically, it means the short squeeze if fully on because the shorts are starting to flip.Nvm, for some reason, Indians cannot invest in US derivatives. FML no tendies for me.\n\nI hope Dalal street is as wild as Wall Street.You will, because it's happening. \nGod i love i discovered gambling - Mondays are my favourite days.

Don\u2019t take financial advice from this sub.\n\nBasically the rule of thumb is not to invest money you can\u2019t stand to lose. Stocks are always safer because you can exit before things get really bad, aka you lose money but not all of it.Cannot give advice on timing. It depends on your own circumstances.IV is one of the metrics used to price options. GME IV is insanely high so premium is expensive. If IV comes down the premium will be much lower and you may not make gains even if the price moves in your favor.It means buy callsHey, on the plus side, that means you've survived ten years in this game.

Great timing as usual, missed out them gains.$30 easy with the Sony deal being announced. $40 optimistic. $50 if these fucking autists play this right.\ud83c\udf1b20 short term. Long term?? They\u2019re making a serious play at shifting into cybersec and getting their OS into all sorts of EV manufacturers.\n\nA former employee ( or random internet shill who knows) posted a bunch about how their security was top notch a decade before everyone elses and from what I\u2019m reading it seems pretty accurate.\n\nLook at the fucking IOT bullshit security. Some guy with an IOT bondage device literally got his cock trapped by hackers. That\u2019s the world we live in.\n\nBB and their secure OS will prevent electric cars from cock jacking. You heard it here first. BB 4000 2023Market insider I guess it drops little bit. No big deal it's gonna moon to day guys \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Dude you already know the answer common \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Don\u2019t be a rainbow bear. Rainbow bears said that when GME was $10. Now they are sad pandas.brooooI own 1k shares at 10.50$Yes please for the love of god pick 1/22\n\n\nGives you more time for those gains\n\nI have a 11c 1/22 and 12.5c 1/22How many calls? Thinking of going in on this \ud83d\ude80What\u2019s the different between that and if I do $10c 3/19?Buy shares dude don't gambling for 1 dayOnly if you have the buying power to execute the contractDon\u2019t let them expire, sell them before then at profit.You make your profit based on the interest in the contract and how much time is left in it. You can still make a small profit without reaching the break even price if it starts to move up in a way that the contract becomes more valuable for it\u2019s strike price. Once you see what your max profit is like you want to sell to close before stock price and the contract price falls more. It\u2019s easy to miss ouut and for the contract to fall in price quickly but sometimes you gotta be patient too. To be honest I don\u2019t know shit about delta theta and all that other stuff but there are tools online that you can see how the contract is valued on a chart by searching the stock on the website.Depends on your broker... I know robinhood sells the contract for you if you don't have enough purchasing power.  \n\nBut it's usually it's a good idea to NOT let it expire and sell for profit a day beforeWait, let me ask your wifesame. i jumped in after a december DD, bought 1/15 9c and sold 2 days ago at -95%. I cant believe my timing.Same here for a loss. Feels bad. I still have a Jan 2022 15c I bought last month though.Profit is profit manNot just Sony. APPLE will use QNX for their car. LION, LI, NIO, XPENG all have QNX\n\nQualcomm partnership with QNX\n\nDon't sleep on thisPossibly $30 by EOW? Please let BB be the next GME. I have 50% of my portfolio on this stockI was reading $100+  ...was that realistic at allKeep holding \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Tried to look it up but couldn't find it. But ya I think wall St is finally becoming aware of this. Have a few 2022 calls luckily. Wish they were higher strike. Might roll them upDo I buy when the market opens or wait a lil?Fuck it gonna sell all my positions and yolo it \ud83d\ude80What\u2019s a good call?BROOOOHow long you planning to hold before selling?Thank you <32042 or 69So if the stock price drops below my set stock price I have to buy? Or do I just lose the premium paid?ok this makes sense i think thank u for helping a tardshes at her boyfriends house on weekdays good luck reaching herAnd what is this QNX you talking about? Am retarded.$30 by EOM. It will be the next GME if we use our collective will to make it so.EOW would be literally today.Depends if boomers realize the significance of blackberry being in damn near every EV. Unfortunately boomers always disappoint so I think $100 is overly optimistic.Just put in orders to sell everything at open \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I have 12c 2/5\n\nEdit: probably going to buy more 12c 2/5 calls$10c 3/19I personally plan on holding a couple of months with the sort of news they have been dropping.  I think post-covid we are going to be seeing a real surge in EV related markets, especially with many places trying to push electric vehicles by certain years.I have no know idea. But I know exactly that it'll be \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 next couple months.No problem <3Gonna do 12 of 1/22 15c, wish I could do more lolDrops below the strike? Then it can\u2019t exerciseQNX is an Operating System designed by Blackberry that's geared towards Artificial intelligence. The main target is Autonomous vehicles (EV OR ICE doesn't matter). Every OEM is basically writing their own Autonomous driving program but none of them have a developed OS.\n\nBlackberry QNX is already in 175m cars and it will only rise with EV\n\nOnly other competition is Linux, which when it comes to safety regulations it will not passMisspelled, I meant to click M instead of W. I need to sleepfuck... well i\u2019m still hard either way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Shit....i mainly do long term investment but I\u2019m going to ride the BB ship.Personally after this much of a gain, I wouldnt touch long options cause of IV. I have stocks and might sell some puts to open.Ok I think I understand. Will read more. Thank you \u2764Which cars already use this out of curiosity? I\u2019ve been sleeping on BB so all this is new to me.Linux isn\u2019t really one thing. That said, you\u2019re correct. The trend with shit products is to develop something running on internal Linux.\n\nThis is great and high quality IF you have high quality dev team AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERS to make sure that your underlying product is secure.\n\nWhat you end with most of the time? A product that has a hole somewhere in the underlying OS that no one is good enough to notice and patch. \n\nThe amount of IOT devices I see that are literally a shit app slapped onto a random Linux distro and slapped into thin plastic and no hardening is ridiculous. IOT Cameras with open telnet ports, IOT bondage devices that get hacked and peoples genitals literally held hostage by hackers ( google it lol ), it\u2019s crap.\n\nWhat QNX offers - from what I gather, I\u2019m far from in the loop on car tech - is an OS they can build off of that is secure instead of an app they slap together.\n\nSo it\u2019s not quite in competition with Linux, Linux isn\u2019t one monolithic thing. That said, yeah BB all the way.God damn it, all in it is!True true, I\u2019ll see what happens on market open. Also have my eyes on SENS.Def look into it. There\u2019s a lot of helpful articles or YouTube videos. For the Greeks focus on theta to start and then IV. It will help you understand WHY the contact is priced where it isXPENG uses it primarily so far I believe in their *Xpeng* P7.Yea I'm not a programmer so I only know as far as what I've researched. What I really meant to say is currently on the commercial sector there's no real competition to Blackberry QNX. I only listed Linux as a possible competitor just because I'm pretty sure tesla AP is built on it or Ubuntu. That being said when it comes to safety regulations and network security, BB will shine all the way since you can't regulate Linux programsYes Sir...thank you very muchSony's new car has it.\n\nApple car supposedly is partnering with Hyundai. Some are saying that's it's Canoo EV instead. Doesn't matter \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 both of those autonomous programs are built on QNX.\n\nNio partnered with Nvidia. Nvidia is partnered with Desay SV's Autonomous driving program with Li Auto. That program is built on QNX. Nvidia is also partnered with BB. Safe bet Nio will run DESAY on QNX\n\nLion EV QNX\n\nBaidu electric car? geely autonomous driving... Built on.... U guessed it.I agree entirely.

I don\u2019t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.\n\n$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn\u2019t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I\u2019m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Case: \n\n1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  \n\nThe digital game sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the \ud83d\udc3b are right, but they\u2019re right in 8 years which means they\u2019re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more\npeople go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don\u2019t care about the fractionally\nlarger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. \n\nBlockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster\u2019s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster\u2019s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.\n\nGamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  \n\nEveryone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.\n\n2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt\n\nThis is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.\n\n3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.\n\nGamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.\n\nGamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a \"digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment\"\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Case\n\nThis MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  \n\nThis has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you\u2019re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don\u2019t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  \n\nSimply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?\n\n\nTLDR:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 But not because of the MOASS.", "score": 96, "comment": "**If this is [spam](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide) you can vote to remove it and earn setting your own flair.**\n\n| **Remove It (0)** | **Keep It (1)** |\n|--------|:-------|-------:|:------:|\n| [Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=kyyoa0&message=spam) | [Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=kyyoa0&message=approve)|\n\n[Click Here to Change Inaccurate Post Flair](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=postflair%20CHANGEME&message=kyyoa0)\n___\n ^comment ^will ^disappear ^--- ^21 ^shitposts ^removed ^since ^last ^crash ^--- ^[information](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot) ^--- ^[leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard) ^--- ^[REWARDS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot_commands)I\u2019m doubling down on Tuesday. \ud83d\ude80>They\u2019re pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.\n\nRyan Cohen follows *only* 4 accounts on Twitter: WSJ, Financial Times, Geekwire, and.........**PC GAMER**.\n\nHe knows **exactly** what he\u2019s doing.\n\nShorts and gay bears are absolutely fucked. He was subtly warning them for *weeks* on Twitter to get the fuck out but they didn\u2019t listen and now they will incur the wrath of his giant 420.69 foot Chewy cock. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Another bull case is that sideways churn hurts bears way more than bulls with the interest they're paying. If it goes up, bears lose. If it goes sideways, bears lose. If it goes down and some bears cover, it goes back up and rest of bears lose.\n\nBears right now are rats on a sinking (rising) ship. As soon as any news comes out that GME is on a turnaround they will eat each other alive to get out.As an inexperienced trader, the build up to the big squeeze has been very stressful\u2014despite the obvious, massive opportunity, I\u2019m convinced I\u2019ll find a way to cuck myself into little or no profit. I\u2019ve seriously developed an uncontrollable and absolutely infuriating eye twitch from thinking about it.\n\nI\u2019ve read god knows how many $GME posts over the past week and none of them provided the kind of cathartic confirmation bias you\u2019ve just given me. Because, whence the squeeze hath been squozzed, this will still be a great company, with great leadership and a bright future and that\u2019s something I want to be a part of. \n\nGME REENTRY AFTER I GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE MOON \ud83d\ude80Long live Cohen. Long live Roaring Kitty. Long live Rod. Long $GMEThe only point you need:\n\nA digital download of Cyberpunk was $60. A physical copy for PC with the OST officially printed, with stickers, box art, a physical map and a necklace of Samurai\u2019s logo was $60.\n\nWho got the better value?Well written, rational DD.  Thank you.\u201cThe digital sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b arguments, is weak\u201d\n\nSomebody give this man an awardBro dont you ever put GME and Blockbuster in the same DDThis guy's last post was 7 years ago and about japanese watches. I don't knows seems fishyToo many wordsI don\u2019t understand how they think there will be a digital store.  \n\nIf I want to download a new ps4 game.... it comes from the PlayStation store.  There\u2019s no reason why they would add a middle man like GameStop for a download actually makes zero sense.Go back to r/stocks with this garbage DDValue stocks? Idk sounds kinda gay to meSame here. What\u2019s another thousand now when we\u2019re literally going to the moon \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I have no idea what GME will do if it does squeeze, but it might not be just a rise and it sets there.  Or it might.   Point being I think some people will be caught off guard, depending on what it does.   If the squeeze is more gradual then it's going to be like boiling a frog -- so slow you may not recognize it.   If the squeeze is sudden, you may miss it by holding out too long before it dips down (provided it dips down).  I think the VW squeeze only lasted 4 or so days as a massive sharp spike before the price came way down (and never returned to peak squeeze price).\n\nThis could be tricky if you're trying to predict the absolute top.   I can't tell you what to do as I'm not a financial advisor or expert, but I already have limits set to auto sell my shares at various prices in chunks.  I won't be kicking myself if it shoots much higher though, because really gain is gain in my book.  As long as I don't sell below my average cost I'm pretty happy.\n\nI do wonder if this is going to last months until the next Earnings Report or if it will be sooner.   (Or if it never truly squeezes in the way we are expecting)If you bought shares sit back and enjoy the ride. Remember you\u2019re not the one on borrowed time, shorts are. We have no time limit. We\u2019re playing a staring contest but shorts don\u2019t realize we\u2019re blind (and retarded).You know what else is long?  \ud83c\udf46Honestly, the digital copy is more valuable to me. IDGAF about stickers and art and I do like not having to leave the house.Check the price of the other watch I posted.thats what the TLDR is forSteam, epic launcher, blizzard... games are more then console.If you're bad at thinking, try reading things that smarter people have thought of.\n\n1. Cross-platform downloads. That's right, it can be downloaded and played on PC and consoles for one cost.\n\n2. Money back on digital \"returns\" means less of a cost commitment than literally any other download service.\n\n3. Physical stores switching to PC-building stores, which opens up custom builds to the majority of people who are too dumb and/or lazy to build one themselves.\n\nMicrosoft just agreed to give GME a percentage of *all* downloads from the Microsoft store. Do you really think your 30 seconds of \"thought\" is smarter than all of Microsoft's management? GME is going to be the comeback of the decade, and everyone knows it except for Melvin and people like you.I think memberships are key. Not sure if that\u2019s in their plan, but it could potentially play a huge role in how they incentivize people to buy. If they make enough from subscribers, the games could come with a lower price tag. Almost everything is subscription based now days. I could be wrong though.I believe they are also getting a cut of all digital sales in the xbox shop for xboxes sold through Gamestop.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_comingBecause they\u2019re shifting their focus from software to hardware.

I see their quarterly report from September which was a few months agoOh also, Mexico quite literally has a deadline of April for marijuana legalization. They had a December deadline, but it was extended to April. Could be earlier, but I don't see it happening later. This is gonna add massive market values to all cannabis companies in a position to make moves. Imports won't be allowed, but businesses will be allowed to open in mexico. \n\nThis is why I like CRON sitting on 1.2b cash.Why CRONYeah I had some 1/15 $16 calls that did really well for TLRY.You can just Google it, and go to the financials tab. Says 1.1b.They're sitting on 1.2b in cash, thanks to Altria (Marlboro). Not only should they sky rocket based on positive news, they are sitting on a mountain of cash to purchase the prettiest assets as new reform takes place.I\u2019m holding TRLY and APHA shares, selling CSPs. Both have been great. I\u2019m very happy the sector as a whole is really doing well, I have... high hopes for the future.CRON ca simply use Altria's extensive experience in oroduct/brand development (think Marlboro) and distribution nextwork of over 250,000 point of sale locations where CRON can plug and play their products into.I see what you did there and I like it \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yeah, there's really no valuation you can put on Altrias distribution network that's gonna be greedy to start selling weed drinks, edibles, vape pods..etc. I've never felt safer that my money will \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. I plan to dump everything into my CRON calls leading up to news starting about Federal action. Then I'll stop buying and wait for the law to pass, sell all calls and switch to shares to ride out with and eventually adding calls prior to future catalysts.

It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.\n\nFirst, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. \n\nQ3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)\n\n* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  \n\n   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.\n   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.\n* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.\n* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.\n* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.\n* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.\n\nQ4 Preliminary Results:\n\n[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)\n\n* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.\n* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.\n\nIt smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. \n\n*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:\n\n\\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.\n\n\\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)\n\n\\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)\n\nFubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, on to the NBA:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)\n\n\"Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV\u2019s formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world \u2013 Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.\"\n\nDavid Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.\n\nWhy am I bringing up the NBA?\n\n[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)\n\nPeople are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. \n\nThe NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, lets look into two key acquisitions: \n\n\\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. \n\nBalto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)\n\n34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. \n\nSince the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. \n\nShort term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.\n\nLong term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute.", "score": 84, "comment": "Buy calls ASAP, show those \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bI don't even know what fubo TV is and I have calls, tf is wrong with the rest of you?You wrote this report?\n\nWhat\u2019s your process for DD?

Willoughby at\u00a0newaction@pomlaw.com\u00a0or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.\nThe investigation concerns whether fuboTV and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.JjI did write this.\n\nGraduated USC, ran the accounting department of a local commercial real estate company until 2020 until i realized commercial real estates future looked pretty bleak and left to develop low income housing projects with my partner. This gave me a lot more free time to delve into stocks and I really like what I see from Fubo. We do a lot of DD in commercial real estate and I was always taught that it\u2019s more important to look for reasons not to buy a property.\n\nMy DD just comes from being obsessed in finding as much about a company as I can. I scour twitter and stocktwits for leads to research and fact check, and in doing so I find and connect missing pieces. My process is to try and find anything to convince myself NOT to invest in a hype stock such as this one, and so far the only red flags I see are those typical of high growth startups that aren\u2019t profitable yet. This always comes with scale, and Fubo is on the way.Use thinkorswim or any of the many websites with company financials and earnings/growth data.Did you ever give a look to the info in the investor relation section of a firm? that's where you should start your DDFubo isn\u2019t a Chinese stock though.

You referenced Netflix a few times but they were one of the first streaming platforms and therefore had a huge advantage to gain their foothold and acquire customers for much cheaper.\n\nI really like their plan of integrating sports and live betting as it has massive potential, but what\u2019s to stop every other network and streaming service from doing the same thing? Once it\u2019s federally legalized I\u2019m sure platforms like Amazon/YouTube tv/Hulu/espn+/cable networks etc will all jump on board and already have a significant scale and funding advantage. \n\nI\u2019m intrigued by Fubo and have considered jumping in (so thanks for the write-up), but that\u2019s the main thing holding me back. You\u2019ve clearly done a lot more research than me so please feel free to tell me why I\u2019m wrong.I appreciate the response, it\u2019s helpful. I think your background in accounting also helps a lot when it comes to interpreting earnings reports as well... yes, being skeptical is very important. Most people tend to seek information to confirm their bias- glad you\u2019re smart enough to do the opposite.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about fundamentals, but I do know about unusual options activity. And there\u2019s been some significant calls sweeps in FUBO recently... they\u2019ve been buying every dip so far. I followed the call sweepers and picked up some February calls on Friday... maybe if we get a little volatility this week, I can get some cheaper shares too.This IS the wayThanks, I actually didn\u2019t even consider thinkorswim. But I have seen the tab where I can research a company. I\u2019ll give that a try.I have. I usually see press releases or power point presentations designed to get investors excited about the company... it is a good start, but doesn\u2019t usually enlighten me much.Certainly\n\n>fuboTV, Inc. is a digital entertainment company. The company is focused on offering consumers a live television (TV) streaming platform for sports, news and entertainment through fuboTV. fuboTV is a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) that streams in 4K. Its subscription-based services are offered to consumers who can sign-up for accounts at https://fubo.tv, through which it provides basic plans with the flexibility for consumers to purchase the add-ons and features suited for them. **The company was founded by David Gandler, Alberto Horihuela Suarez, and Sung Ho Choi on February 20, 2009 and is headquartered in New York, NY.**\n\n(https://money.cnn.com/quote/profile/profile.html?symb=CRCOD)It is not shameful! It is just important since you made a comment about profitability; it wasn't even off the ground for 6 years.This is actually a key metric companies like Netflix uses strategically \n\nhttps://innovationtactics.com/contribution-margin-learn-netflix/\n\nPretty absurd how many people fall for these tacticsHere is original link\n\nhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-pomerantz-law-firm-043000181.htmlThere\u2019s nothing proprietary about it, you\u2019re right. However, being the first to do it, do it right, and market it correctly has it\u2019s advantages. \n\nTheoretically anyone can make another Netflix; hell, I made a copy for a post-grad CS project. The difference is Netflix did it first, they had the right positioning and infrastructure as cable-cutting was taking off. \n\nIf FUBO can do the same with integrated sports betting and discounted cable packages, I\u2019d say they have a brand.That\u2019s kind of like asking what\u2019s stopping yahoo from launching a sports betting platform like DraftKings since yahoo is primarily what people use for fantasy leagues.\n\nYahoo is not likely to enter the sports betting space as it can be considered a conflict of interest for them. Same can be said for ESPN+.  These companies are more likely to partner with fubo than be direct competitors. \n\nAmazon and Hulu are also just getting into content creation, trailing Netflix by years. They are waiting to see how sports betting pans out with companies like fubo before entering themselves, if at all. Fubo will have first mover advantage, which is huge.studying the annual report instead of the synthetic pp presentation imo is a necessity if you are thinking to give money to a firmYeah maybe. I don\u2019t know if companies are waiting to see if it works for Fubo before doing it themselves, it\u2019s more the whole \u201cnot being federally legal\u201d thing holding them back. \n\nThey will have the first mover advantage, but it\u2019s going to be a very slim/short advantage before there\u2019s plenty of other options in the space. It will need to be a fantastic product and user experience to maintain that edge. I personally haven\u2019t used it or have any friends that use it, and of course the Sportsbook and integration of that is yet to happen, so I can\u2019t speak to what the product is like. \n\nSomebody is going to make a ton of money in this space, and it could very well end up being Fubo if the company is run well and has a good marketing team. So just for that potential I\u2019ll probably open a position to go along with my dkng and penn, especially if it dips a little more!Yahoo is literally in the sports betting / daily fantasy business:\n\nhttps://sports.yahoo.com/dailyfantasy", "linkFlairText": "DD", "totalAwardsReceived": 2, "rating": 2.2363048490410358}, {"id": "kyqwlk", "stockTicker": "GME", "title": "$GME - this guy was SELLING January 15th $20 naked calls the day before The Great Squeeze on Wednesday.

We need to start a gofundme so this guy can buy some.That mother fucker got wrecktSelling naked calls on a stock that is already supply squeezed and volatile is the height of lunacy. Some of these boomers talk out of both sides of their fucking mouth when it comes to risk tolerance and margin of safety.What garbage can is that fool eating out of nowadays?> I will be long gone.\n\nHey, when you're right, you're right.lmao were boutta resize his assLook at us. We are the captains now.As annoying as these clueless boomers are, there are a lot of fucking boomers in the world. Imagine if we actually had the patience to provide them with real DD. They might actually get other boomers to buy in, making the squeeze even a bigger certainty.That cigar puff was the one that lighted the fuelHe\u2019s prob eyeing $ROPE rn. Poor boomer \ud83d\ude2dDo boomers not know the power we possess smhNew to investing and generally just retarded anyways, but anyone care to explain how much he could have lost betting against GME?Davey showing \"Mr Shapiro\" the big red.Well at least now he may not have much money left to looseHe sold on Tuesday, the right for people to buy at $20. The stock was in $35+. So he lost at least $15x100=$1,500/contract and said he sold a lot.Well he's right, he is long gone, calls on $ROPEPlot twist Andrew is challenging usLong gone is definitely one way to put it, if he\u2019s talking about his bank account on those options.Hope he didnt $ROPE and will give us more fun in the future.WSB is about to anger fund a dying company just to get a few hedge funds to close down for talking smack llol\n\n500 shares strong boys \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80That\u2019s me.

IM THE GUY WHOS GONNA BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!!! WITH THE CIGAR BUTT!!!Truer words were never spokenHaha. This Guy is so lost!tried to upvote twice.I'm another retard trying to learn but if I'm correct then this means you bought 10 calls (each 100 shares) at $20. GME was >35 on Friday so you made something like 15k?I\u2019m a literal retard the numbers you just posted. I think I understand the first digit is a quantity of 10 the second is a date of January 15, but what is the 20c?Im so mad right now. I wish I could buy more. As soon as I get the cash I'm rage buyingbuy more shares, make WSB rich  \n\n\nwe buying our own island with hookers and blow free for allI am here to support the good fight brother. I\u2019m in with 2 shares Monday. Fuckin send it.At this point he has entered retard territory and is prime for this sub\u2019s picking. Someone send him the holiday sales report and the shorts volume from Melvin. He might cave and become fuel for us.What the fuck kinda weird fascination with cigars would it take to make *multiple* cigar metaphors within a week? Shit's makin' Monica Lewinsky blush...He is probably all talk with no position.Seeking Alpha is just a cesspool for shitty opinions. 2 Authors 3 pseudointellectual opinions.Career ending fuck up if his sizing was largeRight. why doesn\u2019t Andrew Shapiro read wsb? Fucking idiotI ll be long gone\" says the guy with the grey hair.Rotated into $ROPEI mean I feel like people here forget that these type of people and institutions don't go all in like us retards. They probably follow the Kelly Criterion Formula and play no more than 5% in one play.I\u2019m assuming he just held until expiration, sold the shares at $20, and made a profit. Obviously, not the profit he would have made if he just held the shares. But no moron is going to sell calls at a lower strike than what he paid for the shares, so he still sold higher than he bought inThe hidden truths of wall st: They are all as stupid as we are.He's a fucking boomer. He's doesn't get that the world moved on from his boomer bullshit 15 years ago. He probably prints his emails and files them under correspondence.Usually if they are strongly opposed to a stock, they are somehow financially invested in that opinionSemi-related: The 07-09 bloodbath was interesting, as it was the first real big crash to happen with a somewhat mature internet-as-we-know-it today in place. \n\nAll sorts of investing sites had blowhards, ham-and-eggers, fakers, frauds, hypers and retards posting article after article, basically as one-eyed men in the valley of the blind. A bunch of zero-insight droolers mindlessly repeating the most inane investing maxims, and how so-forth was your last chance to get in on a \"gamechanger\" or an \"undervalued SWAN stock\".\n\nThen, the crash happened, then they just vanished. Poof. They once had an audience who listened, then, when the tide went out and everyone saw they were swimming totally naked, so they just stopped posting. Many deleted their accounts, their articles... Since that time, social media really came around and every now and then, I look them up. \n\nOne big talking former article-writer is now a bank teller. Another, an HVAC guy. A couple \"certified financial planners\", some \"cryptocurrency investors\", \"domainers\", etc. These were dudes with bio pics in suits and ties who once confidently told others how to invest their money when the rising tide raised all ships but once actual skill/insight/knowledge was required, they just quietly went away and back to incredibly mediocre day jobs. \n\nSo, other than PLTR to the moon, be careful who you listen to. At least WSB doesn't take itself seriously. \nDon't take anyone seriously who doesn't post their own performance.> Does every single \"financial guru\" really have no idea wtf they're doing? Or are they all just this stubborn?\n\nyes.YES! everyone is absolutely convinced its already died and don't truly see the potential GME has to transition because they really do NOT understand the gaming industry. It's hilariously sad to watch.Yep stubborn and sometimes don't know shit about technology.Of course he does he's a fucking boomer. They have all the cash they stole from the future generations. We'll make him lose it all thoughis this the explanation for what's going on with Melvin's short position too? They're rolling that 55M in puts over to some future date at a new strike ?Gone like his hairline.One of us and he doesn\u2019t even know it... yet \ud83d\ude02That\u2019s why he was selling weeklies...Read what he said again.Typically selling weeklies is pry smart not here thoLolWhat do you guys think about 50 dollar calls for Tuesday? Or just get more shares?\n\nEdit: never mind will buy more shares and maybe 1 or 2 callsFNever. We all make our choices, and must lie in them good or bad. They ecannot be mourned. They must learn, and grow as most of us did. Mourn not those that never stood a chance. Rejoice when they are born again as \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32Go back through your history and post that shit up, the only thing that excites me more that hot milf porn is retard gain porn, and the only thing that excites me more than that is boomer loss porn.Go on ...Selling naked calls is more retarded than the yolo calls we buy into hereThere are girls in this sub? LolFSometimes it feels like the more and the louder the autism leaks, the more the dying dumb boomers feel like they need to prove themselves. That's when they get rekt and give us our money back. And I'm okay with it.Someone posted it is 138% as of 1/15Sounds like officially it is updated every two weeks but other data services try to estimate it between thenThey don't realize their time has come and gone. All they have is the wealth they stole from the future generations. WSB will have him eating out of a garbage can soon.As he sold naked calls he could lose 100*(current share price -premium-20) * amount of contracts. So if someone exercised em at like the peak of 43 $ he would lose like 2000 dollars per contract he soldIf he was truly selling naked calls, the losses could theoretically be infinite. It just depends how many contracts he actually sold.i dunno about the 20c's specifically but some of the higher strikes (like 30c's) were up over 50,000% after a couple days.\n\nThey went from a premium from pennies to dollar amounts so go figure. There are retail traders out there that are undoubtedly bankrupt from this week. Collecting as little as $5K in premiums from naked calls \"that were never going to print\" would leave them with a loss in the 7 figures (well they've be liquidated before it reached that point, but yeah it will blow up an account)wait, but if you had GME calls, why did you lose 25k?It hasn't yet.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366\n\nHasn\u2019t happened yet.Over on the gamestop subreddit, full of gamestop employees, Cohen has a bad reputation because of his plan to shutter most of the brick and mortar stores.\n\nI'm not very confident in GME long term either, but don't straight up ignore fundamental changes.Who cares about long term about this company. Sell at the peak and move onto the next stock.Cohen will convert it into an online mega gaming palace. Think about it...tons of gaming stuff and no refrigerators or other crap to sift through. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80don't be a doucheCool it with the anti Semitic remarksI did it for youHe exercised so that means he owns the 1000 shares.he didnt close the contract, he exercised it (actually turned in the option ticket for 100 shares), so you could say that he \"made\" the money but its still in the shares (i fucking hope OP)Calls with a strike price of $20KOBRA KAI never die!!!Underrated comment, we really should do that. And you know what's the transport to get there :rocket:Like Epstein island, but instead of children there\u2019s cocaine.This is the gotdamn way!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8This dude has some fascination for sure.

It\u2019s one of the tell-tale signs.Basically, does Andrew Shapiro look like someone who know anything about video games, gamer culture, or the video game industry? you wouldn't take his advice on whether to buy a PS5 or a Series-X so why on earth would you take his advice on selling close to the money naked calls on a company with a turn around story like this? fucking boomers.\n\nHis opinion is shit, because he doesn't know shit.Right! Amateurs. I saw a seeking alpha article that said why xpev will surge, and then posted THE SAME DAY was another seeking alpha article saying why xpev will go down. TFyeah, sometimes they have some reasonable articles on certain hype stocks like QS or hydrogen stocks. I personally like it because it provides a decent balance to my usual extremely bullish hydrogen/green energy news sources.He probably does now$RopetatedI forget that outside these hallowed walls, yolo is not the norm, however, 'huge vol prem' on naked calls though. Might be in a tad bit more than 5%...They're stupid but we're fucking retarded!!!!!You don\u2019t?He prints charts to literally draw with crayons on themI thought the SEC requires that for everyone that made $6.34 on an options play onceThat's super interesting. Never thought about those people leaving the industry in a downturn, but it makes sense. Just shows that anyone can claim to be an expert when it's super easy to make money in a market.This should be printed and put on a fucking shirt. BeautifulI'm still feeling really good about pltr, I don't understand the recent negativity I've seen here.  Nothing has changed except people saying it went \"sideways for a week\", even though it closed 5% up. Probably salty their shitty 1/15 $40c weren't miraculously printing already.> don't truly see the potential GME has to transition because they really do NOT understand the gaming industry.\n\nWhat do you see that the bears don't?I'm not a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, promise -- but I'm curious what GME's plans are? I missed the initial post that sparked all this and have just been seeing \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nLike, last I heard they got My Body is Reggie and were planning on like being sort of \"internet cafe/hangout\" places -- is that still a thing? Have they done anything along those lines yet, or is it still just all talk?\n\nObviously (to my eyes) they can't continue their current used games business model if the gaming industry transitions to streaming/digital downloads (hence the newer consoles not even having disk drives), but there must be something I'm missing.\n\nHow do they compete as a brick-and-mortar when a lot of the market is going to Steam/Xbox/Sony's digital stores, or if Stadia-esque streaming becomes a regular thing in 5-10 years? Again, I'm genuinely curious; I missed the initial DD on this one.lose\"stole from future generations\"... Lol. A bit jealous? Nothing Wong with hard work.I don't know any rich boomers.  Most worked for decades at a 9-5 and retired modestly.  It's not like that whole generation is filthy rich and conspired against future generations.  That's some tinfoil hat level stuff there.Too stupid for hereDon't worry, you're in the wrong sub if you think he will understand, GUHThe fact that his comment has so many upvotes is disturbingFThanks GhandiFuck yeahYou bet.Dumbass.And you boys make me laugh out loud and give great advice if you know who to follow. \ud83d\ude09FTill the SEC for whatever reason decides to fuck this sub over for market manipulation. We can be retarded here in the sub, we don't have to go scream WSB it everywhere. Sub is full or 15y olds these days.Thank you fellow tard.Yeah that was my quick math as well. I figure he lost at least $1500/contract if they didn't exercise at the peak, but he supposedly sold multiple contracts. Sure would be a shame if his losses were in the 5 figures.\n\n\nAnd by shame, I mean hilarious.He sold themhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366 \n\nHasn\u2019t happened yet.> Cohen has a bad reputation because of his plan to shutter most of the brick and mortar stores.\n\nTo be fair they have waaaaay too many stores, when you hear stories of two gamestops in a single mall then they should be shutting stores, they are as bad as starbucks.Which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Closing stores might be good to maximize profit.thanks, like I said i\u2019m a fucking retard.We will fuck his wife and her boyfriendim taking my own fucking rocket to at least a mil. see you in greece or bahamas!Woah guy, you flying too close to the sun on this one.it seems everybody with the name Shapiro is retardedI'm not sure Gamer Culture has a lot to do with the market thesis hereIdk he looks broke to me. RIPYou really need to stop with this boomer trash talk.  i'm one, and no, I don't know a thing about the video game industry, but I learned a lot about GME from u/deepfuckingvalue.  I'm long 1000 shares.  Dr. Burry is a boomer too, and he's long a few more than I am.  We're in this together.  Ease up dude.It's basically a message board. Market manipulators can go on there and post what they want. So it's not surprising to see contradictory posts.I'm just basing the 5% off of what the experiment suggests id say maybe up to 20-25% would be the most they would play and probably not on a short position but who knows maybe they have just a touch of downs.tards like us, but with suits.No i print them out and scan them in. I'm not an idiot!!!Thanks for the laugh\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are too busy finger popping each other\u2019s assholes to play gamesIt\u2019s not what I see and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s about how they can see the same news and have a completely different perspective. They\u2019ve been assuming GameStop is going to go bankrupt for the last 10 years. \n\nThey only see what they want at this point. \n\nThe bears have nothing new that\u2019s in their favor. Bulls are the only ones that have news that\u2019s in their favor.He\u2019s just describing old guys bungholeOk boomerOk boomerWe actually make money on GME hereYou're welcome. I got your back.FCorrect. It hasnt happened. \n\nThe short interest literally only went up, not down. You know that right?Remember back in march when gamestop decided that their employees were *essential workers*? Everybody's freaking out about the plague and these guys got stuck dragging themselves to work without any PPE or clear preventative measure or nothing.\n\nThey're people getting fucked over by the pandemic that need a job. If you know anybody who's tried to find a job in the last year, you know how harrowing it is. And if somebody gets infected in your household and you're on the hook for the bill for a ICU stay? You're fucked. How do you pay rent? utilities? food? And now a new board wants to come in, lay everybody off and move the business online.\n\nIn most narratives, we're the bad guys here. We're the greedy investors that scream at the board cuz WE WANT TENDIES NOW.\n\nJust something to think about.Welcome homei dont remember this line in the show but i like itMakes him perfect for the sub, shouldn\u2019t we have our professionals recruiting this man for rocket fuel?Boomer is more of a mindset than an age.\n\nI know many completely retarded and close-minded 30 and 40 year olds that I consider to have the boomer mindset and I know 60 and 70 year olds that are cool as fuck that I\u2019d never in a million years call a boomer.

Recently, I decided why not both?\n\nA little background: GM has some short term catalysts in 2021 as a recovery play. It sold the most trucks in the US in 2020 and apparently isn\u2019t yet affected by a semiconductor shortage that is forcing Ford to idle some plants, but the real story here is Cruise.\n\nGM owns Cruise, the SF-based autonomous vehicle technology company, that plans to offer autonomous taxi and delivery services. The total addressable market is $5-8 trillion according to the Cruise CEO. \n\n\u201cDan Ammann, CEO of the GM majority-owned autonomous vehicle subsidiary, on Wednesday said that valuation includes autonomous ride-hailing services to compete against current companies such as Uber and Lyft at a potentially $5 trillion sector; $2 trillion for freight; and $500 billion each for data insights and in-vehicle experiences.\u201d Source: [CNBC ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/gms-cruise-values-autonomous-vehicle-industry-at-8-trillion.html) \n\n*Why now?*\n\n1) Cruise had once aimed to launch a commercial service using so-called \u2018driverless\u2019 vehicles by the end of 2019 (so they must have thought they were pretty close). Cruise started fully autonomous taxi service in SF in December 2020\n\n2) In January, Cruise hired the former COO of Delta, another pretty strong signal they are getting ready for commercialization.\n\n3) In a recent earnings call, GM CEO indicated they were open to a sale of Cruise which was last valued at $19bn. In this market, if they show any sign of progress, should be $100bn (vs current market cap of GM of $71bn). If GM retains minority control, it\u2019s all upside. [Deutsche Bank analyst who asked the question on earnings call explains](https://youtu.be/12XMATuP3_0)\n\n4) GM crushed it at CES, unveiling a flying drone and new business called BrightDrop, \u201cecosystem of electric products, software and services to help delivery companies transport goods more efficiently\u201d\n\n*Price Target* \ud83c\udfaf \ud83c\udf1d \n\nIn December, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas raised its price target to $57, USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 30% to account for execution risk. That\u2019s insanely conservative in my opinion, but hey let\u2019s go with it for a second. Back of the napkin, if the present value is $57/share and the discount rate is 30%, that implies a future value of $420.69 in 7.6186 years. This market has been making moves in dog years and Jonas\u2019s call was made in Dec, so that means we celebrating New Years 2022 in tendie town.\n\nBut seriously, I think we are going to $100 this year which Jonas also cited as a \u201cblue sky\u201d bull case. Under that scenario, Cruise is spun off at $100bn valuation.\n\nI\u2019m just sharing my call, not giving advice.

GM was a boomer stock. Now, because of GME (and Cruise), it has a shot at meme.just curious why the 2023 call isn't OTM and the shorter ones areNo no, you're thinking of the Tesla Model GME.

They\u2019re throwing billions of dollars at these companies with nothing but fiberglass concept shitboxes that have to be towed behind a pickup.  GM is a lot less vaporous than most. In addition to Cruise, which OP outlined, GM is introducing 12 new EVs led by an unholy 1000hp Hummer.The market isn\u2019t rewarding legacy auto for tech investments and every \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bcomment here proves that point. \n\nFord could be a play too, I haven\u2019t done the DD except that I heard they are having some short term manufacturing issues due to a [chip shortage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-other-auto-makers-cut-output-on-chip-shortage-11610280001) and GM is not impacted as of yetBoo.

I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they \"have\" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:\n\n**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**\n\n**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among \"3-4 others in the state\" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as \"PC building stations\".**  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.\"**\n\nNow, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. \n\nHOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty \"in-the-know\" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!\n\nShe also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the \"Next blockbuster!1!!!\" thesis.\n\nPersonally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.\n\n\nPositions: 250 shares @22.30 cost avg, 2x 4/19/21 $30c, 2x 01/29/21 $50c\n\n(Somebody on mobile add the rockets pls)\n\nETA69: Somebody showed me how to do the rockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 LFG!!!\n\nETA420: DON'T GIVE ME GOLD, KEEP THAT MONEY AND FUCKING BUY GME SHARES\n\nETA from one of the commenters below, u/theodros1:\n\n\"Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores. The 1.5 stores will be more \"PC oriented\" and will allow users to choose parts. He didn't confirm \"PC building stations\" but dropped an amazing tidbit. The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.\n\nedit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the \"Cohen news hasn't materialized yet\"... I said him being \"CEO\" and he grunted, I think affirmatively\n\nedit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about \"reset\" of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5\n\nedit 3: Found a 1.5 station, he confirmed OP's post. There will be gamestop stores where we can build out our whole PC in store. Didn't have balls to ask about Cohen as CEO though lol\"", "score": 874, "comment": "GME pivoting to become a bunch of tiny microcenter stores would be dope.THIS IS HUGE!!!  Genius play too. Inspiring the next generation to build PCs, then funnel the new customer base to their online game platform.

You\u2019ve now graduated and can ride a big school bus nowhmmmm I was a blockbuster analogist BUT if this true AND they are going to hire legit nerds (sorry, but you can\u2019t train people to know every little thing about PC components unless they\u2019re passionate) this could be huge.

Didn't have balls to ask about Cohen as CEO though lol\n\nedit 4: called several more stores and it seems that this may be a regional thing. Gamestops in areas outside my state claimed that 1.5 stores were simply larger and had more room to carry supply but did not involve \"building stations.\" One clerk claimed that while they were transitioning to  PC parts, he did not see any stores being building stations. Take this all for what's it worth.This is actually huge, see people don\u2019t understand the niche of the gaming market. They want to buy and support someone who understands them. GameStop revolutionizing themselves into a one stop bestbuy but nerdier is going to be huge and that doesn\u2019t consider all the e-commerce\n\nThat and computers are like phones, everyone wants the latest and greatestI would, 100% build at a kiosk, especially if there were physical representations of things like cases available to see and touch in store. I dislike trying to visualize exactly what it is I'm buying online, worrying about fit and finish or if the GPU is going to be too big for the case or any of that bullshit.\n\nTl:Dr sign me up, GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n$3K MORE ON TUESDAY\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Do they have margaritas on Mars?Walked into a local GameStop can confirm.

They\u2019re sold out of virtually everything at GameStopDE, most  new  booster packs (champions path, vivid voltage etc. were sold out in the first hour. GameStop is already the #1 location for Pok\u00e9mon releases in Germany  since the only other stores getting those packs are one man card shop businesses. There\u2019s another big release coming up In February (shining fates). I\u2019m certain GameStop is in a similar position in the US. Those packs are even reselling at double MSRP, there\u2019s huge potential for GameStop if they manage to secure more stock and sell the hyped booster packs in bundles with less hyped booster packs to profit off of that. I went in store at GameStop 3 days after the release and the clerk told me I was the 25th person to ask him about that booster pack already. I\u2019ll try to find out how many boxes of SF they get if the store is opened again next month (current lockdown). People are saying GameStop is dying but really they are in a good position selling PC parts, games and collectibles like Pok\u00e9mon cards and funko pops.

If he's looking to grow the company, the best way to not only send a message and to get the shorts off the back of the company is to make damn sure the squeeze occurs. ON TOP OF THAT, the amount of brand spanking new loyal consumers that will 100% use their new found money on product and services the store offers if this is successful is gigantic. The free marketing, the loyalty, the brushing off of pressure, all of that would pave a clear road towards Chewy 2.0.\nRyan I hope you're reading this.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80hmmmmmm wasn\u2019t convinced till now but after this i might have to hop on the retard rocketIf Cohen is announced as CEO i might bussThat\u2019s it.

FUCK IBP. Estimated ship date was last week, the only thing they've done in 6 weeks is process my payment. I'd cancel but I feel like at this point a decent company might take longer then IBP will.My local GameStop is always busy and has been for years. I don\u2019t know why people think it\u2019s like block buses. Oh wait, yes I do. It\u2019s because they are retarded.I told my buddy about GME and he said the same thing about pokemon packs - the new ones are completely are sold preorders (Shining Fate boosters). Shorts are fucked\n\nedit: went out to a couple gamestops looking with him, found no pokemon cards of any kindCan confirm average mid range pc is around 600-800$ And those just for entry level these things can easily go over 4K$ GME to the moonWhat if this was supposed to be announced at the IRC and got pulled for some reason. And the manager assumed it was already public knowledge?now imagine if they had employees persuade people into getting online GME game passes that can get you a whole lot of PC games for a monthly fee. we are actually going to the moon boysI will literally drop 10k buying two gaming PCs at GameStop when this happens.\n\nBuying more shares on Monday.

I cannot tell you how frustrating it can be to order PC parts off the internet.  Package delays, damaged product. Or it just doesn't work and you have to go through the hassle of returning the DOA product for a refund and wait another week for your part to arrive while your brand new partially finished PC collects dust.\n\nThere are no in store retailers near me that sell parts and i'm forced to go through someone like Amazon.  I've been itching for a large retailer where i can just walk in and pick my parts at the store and build my new computer THAT DAY.\n\nFucking hell, i'm getting hard at the though of it.  I don't think people realize how many cities across America don't even have a microcenter or anything of the like they can just walk into.\n\nThere is a massive untapped market of retail buyers itching for something like this and they don't even know it yet.  Who knows, 4 or 5 years from now instead of kids lining up to buy the next gen consoles, they will be lining up at gamestop to build their first computer.Glad to see they are making moves. \ud83d\ude80Dude, this makes so much sense.Can confirm the PC stuff, they keep empty boxes bc their shit sells out pretty quickly\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I was literally talking to my co worker about how GME should do this then this post comes outHoly fuck.

Some sort of bundle with GamePass, tech support, free entry into some events or tournaments they host for a year.  Then once you do this you never shop anywhere else for the next 20 years.\n\nLemme throw a rocket in here too \ud83d\ude80It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.\n\nTLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\n\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\n\nto all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Yesterday several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon.

Would 100% use this.You know I\u2019m super happy to see GME be THE comeback kid of 2021. Super fun to watch a company go from gutted stores to evolving into an almost interactive online store, which means the tendie printers up top at GME are coming up with some excellent ways to switch it up.\n\nEdit: A thought I had right after. With GameStop\u2019s everywhere in the US, we could see a store with Hopefully decent of parts and can see our product before we buy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever truly bought computer parts from a brick and mortar store, mostly because nothing around me like that racists, a GameStop exsist a thoughSo $CRSR?This actually makes the Microsoft deal make more sense.

I said him being \"CEO\" and he grunted, I think affirmatively \n\n  \nIf you are playing with my heart, you are doing it wellI have not purchased a console since 2014 specifically because pc gaming is far superior with games and graphics. on top of that a great set up can last for 5+ years before you upgrade parts to more modern parts.

Seems like last week's buying was from longs and not short covering just like what some of the research analysts have been saying. \n\nSome large hedge funds probably have done the same on-the-ground research as you have and they agree with the transformation thesis.\n\nMy take is, it will take two quarters to fully digest what the new store transformation will do to SP. But in the meantime it can certainly rally on optimism. \n\n$50 seems possible in the interim with $100 by eoy if transformation is successful by Sep for back to school sale.\n\nI think a great trade is to buy 2022 or 2023 leaps on Tuesday if price is still cheap.I wonder if they could ammend their deal with Microsoft to include kickbacks on PC sales.I can't find a thing about this anywhere. Hopefully some PC media outlets catch this rumor and do the same diligence some commenters have, and then run a story on it.

I\u2019m going to do research in my local area to see if it\u2019s happening near where I live (large metropolitan area).yo who's wet or hard rn bc got damn... Imagine the tendies once GME gets balls deep in e-sports after creating a bunch of pros w/ these 1.5 storesI've been saying this from the very beginning that GME needs to focus more on PC and am glad to hear they're looking that route.  I have the older generation of consoles, but have been almost exclusively playing on PC for the past 5 years.  PC users also tinker with their rigs too by upgrading various components so you should see recurring revenue.  It sounds like a dope idea.They can become Starbucks for gamersWe should blast Ryan Cohen with \u201cideas\u201d along these same lines in hopes he\u2019ll half-confirm them or something so we can share that on Twitter.Maybe the institutional shorts know this. They are trying to short it as much as possible now, and as time goes on, they buy more and more calls at the correct strikes such that if it slingshots up, the calls are executed at a strike that sells all of their shorts at a profit, and reverses their short position into a long position. So basically short the high, cash out the short and go long at the bottom, and rocket it up to a new high.A news write up of this MOONS the stockIf GameStop pivoted to include like gaming cafes in Asia they would make $$$ and make it a subscription model. America does not have mass gaming cafes. They already have the infra for this.LOLThis is so absolutely THE WAY.\n\nI\u2019m going to sell a large put position on Tuesday I think\n\nEdit: autocorrect[removed]Just an aside, your April calls expire on 16 not 19...in case you have it marked in your calendar as such \ud83e\uddad I am with you @ $29 \u270aAlso remember the website is down having a complete overhaul. Or is that just me in \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7?This reminds me of what Radioshack was doing in the years before bankruptcy. Not to shit on GME, but its true.Is this information legit ?Nice post!\n\nBTW this whole concept reminds me a bit about AutoZone... highly recommend this short video about them from CNBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYNlaLt4jicThey need to M&A with Microcenter. That would be huge!The irony of the company doing the shit I told them to do 2 years ago before they fired me.I used to build my own computer. Like 20 years ago. It is really fun.   \n\n\nMy favorite thing was back then (maybe now still, I dunno) you could buy a cheap Intel chip and get a motherboard that allowed for overclocking and you could basically get the incredibly expensive, top of the line Intel CPU performance out of the really chip CPU and save a bundle. Typically, tho, building your own PC was far more expensive than buying something off the shelf unless you found a good cheap place for the parts.\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude80No f-Ing way .  This is way too niche to mane any real $$$.  The PC parts business is super competitiveWhat\u2019s a PC?For people that enjoy paying 6 times markup on low margin partsGuys, the only decent bull case right now is the short squeeze continuing.\n\nNews and performance of the company don't matter if you are buying now, it's purely technical.\n\nIf you wait for that bubble to pop a bit and come in after the dust settles in this thesis, I'm with you on it.\n\nAll this to say GME 420C 01/29/2021.I realize why all the people here call everyone autists.\n\nY'all might make some money on this but how many times the mods gonna tell you this is illegal. It's not worth tanking all of WSB for a payout, especially not from GME....So, basically what you're saying is that their gaming business is dead and they are desperately coming up with ridiculous ideas to save the company.PC gamers would never build their rigs at a GameStop... lmfao, maybe some fortnight kidOrder your fucking parts online and assemble in your basement like a fucking normal person. GameStop looks and smells like Spencers fucking Gifts to me. Or worse, Build-a-Bear. What useless tripe. Retail for idiots.\n\nI suppose that there are a LOT of computer idiots who might think themselves on their way to hacker status if they finally build their own computers...Huge news if true. I'll increase my Put position on Tuesday if they confirm this business strategy. \n\nFirst of all, Gamestop employees are in no way qualified to speak with any confidence about the technical PC parts needed for high-end gaming rigs. \n\nThey are part-time High School kids who weren't even born when Battletoads came out. \n\nBesides, this business model has been tried once before. The company was called RadioShack. They also had Trump Steaks and Sharper Image massagers - and they failed.\n\nBut I guess Gamestop has Funko dolls, so there's that.Right? Microcenter doesn't have anywhere near the spread of GME stores either. My closest microcenter is like an hour away.\n\nI told the manager I would use that service to buy my next gaming PCRC must have othe plans than just convenience microcenters. I am expecting expecting a turn to tech.is a tiny microcenter a nanocenter?  \n\n# \ud83e\udd14Been screaming this and getting yelled at from the non GME people... they could have exclusives too with Corsair or Razr or whoever... huge move if true. Pcpartspicker meets micro centerGME is going to be what you get when you mix Microcenter with Build-A-Bear.  GET HYPE!ThisThere was a fucking line to get in the one by the Hibachi place a couple hours ago. Makes me want to go in and check on my investment.This is the kind of move I can get behind, but knowing how stingy Gamestop is on deals that don't involve used games I'm not holding my breath that they will ultimately be a good place for pc builders to buy their parts, and I have to imagine any prebuilts that would come out from them are going to be pricey as well.You're not getting microcenter storage at tiny strip mall locations :/ \n\nMaybe gamestop will just become newegg but without the scalping and fucking horrible customer service and RMA bullshit when you need a simple return.Thank you!!!!I\u2019ve been preaching they need a steam/epic like app and compete in that market, that\u2019s a huge move though and that would need to have been in the works a while. But if that is the case GME could become a monster of hardware and software gamingMost PC parts are low-margin thoughYes. And remember this is just one small part of their overall re-posturing effortLookup microcenter in the meantime\n\nEdit: ah thought you meant los angelesLegit nerds? Where is your line on nerd? Some fuckhead who can plug a graphics card into a motherboard? If this is anything like Geek Squad, GTFO.Fry's is bankrupt / closing isn't it? I've heard they're finally closing after not restocking inventory for a long time.ehm... have you tried to assemble a PC? It is as difficult as small set of lego for 10-12 year old. I literally build my own PC 5 years ago without prior building experience. Had some trouble connecting pins on the motherboard but all this shit was overall easy. Stop exaggerating, you don't need to be \"passionate\", lolEven a boomer can learn to build their own PC.  It's literally like LEGO's.RadioShack tried this and failed - hard.It's this sort of shit that's on the ground all about customer-business interactions that those homos at Melvin don't do. Just assholes killing a company that wants to give people something they want. We have actually out done them with market research. Unbe-fucking-leivable. I love you guys.now this is DD. actual investigations going onFuck yeah. Yeah I think she probably gave away more than she was supposed to... I'm not gonna cite the specific store because I don't want to get her in trouble. She was very informative and helpfulAlso in October, the deal with MSFT was [announced](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/).\n\nThey\u2019re shifting all their business operations to the Microsoft 365 stack, including CRM Dynamics.  They\u2019ll be setup for better data driven decisions and collaboration.  It also equips all staff with Surface devices on the sales floor.  Maybe something like the Apple store where there\u2019s not really a register anymore.  Just checkout with the employee anywhere.\n\nThis deal also includes a GME cut of all digital sales from Xboxes sold from GME for the life of the console.  That\u2019s some nice extra revenue for essentially little effort.  And this happened in October!  I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ll see how much they made from that deal with nextgen console sales in their next quarterly.Holy shit this just gave me the biggest fucking chills in my life.... if they plan to discuss this to the public fully anytime soon then good luck trying to even get in.Cohen isn\u2019t CEO yet??Have a reward for your effort\ud83d\ude80Holy fuck. \n\nI'm in for $2k on TuesdayA random guy at a GameStop that knows about Cohen? Sounds unlikely.This is fantastic! Thanks for sharingNow this is journalism I can subscribe to.Same! trying to figure out compatibility etc before ordering is a pain in the ASSMakes me wonder if they'll have Geek Squad type employees who will build it for you for a price or if they'll just help you assemble the parts.I can't tell if the posts are made by tards or bots. But count me in on thinking they are dumb either way.I'll bring some if they don't yet!I think they call them marsgaritas.For sure. But the manager seemed convinced they were pushing forward. Go call your local GME stores and see what they say.Given the general sentiment in this post we should probably call RC and make it true\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFuck yeah thanks man! Im a boomer lmaoHoly fucking shit, you are a fucking smoothbrained heroWow, you just changed my life! \ud83d\ude31My old graphics card was so heavy it literally loosened my PCI express slot on my mobo. I really need a new one, so Melvin pay up already.Same, my graphics card is slowly dyingOnly at GME?Maybe board chairman is better> Linus tech tips \n\nOh yeah, their secret shopper episodes were so good but at the same time showed very much, how much potential there is. Especially with those people who don't know how to build a PC and who also don't want to know. And those are a LOT.Do I hear GME dedicated discord server with wsb mods at the forefront?It was definitely pulled for a reason.  You gotta lock up your trash so the bears cant get into it.With your gains, just buy the entire fucking store. \ud83d\ude80Furniture, peripherals... The \ud83c\udf1d's the limit.Sign me up for an RGB headset, keyboard, and mouse. As long as its 15% off if I bought all of it separate, I would go for it.I bought at 19, it went to 21. I bought at 21, it went to 31. Bought at 31, went to 39. Bought at 37, went down to 35. I havent taken a big L this whole time I've been fueling this rocket with you retards and you haven't lead me astray yet. \n\nWe ride this shit the fuck out because when this moons, $5, $10, $20 differences will not matter in the scope of tendies and we will dip them in the blood of Melvin Capital bank coffers!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80My 550 shares are locked and loaded to sell at 420.69. I think there will be a lot of market resistance at that point.Yeah, the shittiest part of assembling a PC rig is that you have to buy MSFT Windows separately (relatively expensive). \n\nI used to pirate windows in the past, but now that I have a respectable income I buy it. MSFT office is expensive as well (and a must for most people).\n\nMaybe this is in part where the microsoft deal comes in with GME?This needs to be at the topEveryone I see is saying buy stocks.stocksAt least 100 shares ... gamble the rest of you want or pick up more shares.Stocks and fucking hold them things.stock and then limit sell at 420.69 so they can\u2019t loan your shares to shortsFrom personal experience, when I build a PC, I go ham and future proof that baby for at least 5 years. I've seen people comparing rigs to phones, but i disagree. It all comes down to if my PC can play the newest fallout, COD, Cyberpunk, etc. on max settings or not.Dude. It's a value play inside a squeeze play. We should be 50 on fundamentals. At least. If news like this was true and got out, shorts are dead. Squeeze soon.Not yet. But we know this sub is HEAVILY monitored and they constantly read what we\u2019re talking about. So if the cats out of the bag wouldn\u2019t you think they\u2019d let the fucking cat out of the fucking bag ASAP? I sure hope so. Especially when they see the hype surrounding it? Make this official Daddy Cohen!AMD and NVDA for sure.Not the best timing for that business model unfortunately.Excuse me?Buy shares.  You would only make the premium on the puts instead of the mad upside of Gme rockets.Are you lost ? Go back to sleepHoly shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*Just checked it here in US. It\u2019s working fine.That was 2015 tough. A lot more people are invested in computers and tech now, we got 40+yr old game streamers now in 2021, so the market has broadened.\n\nI'm just a retard toughInteresting perspective. Is this the final throws, the last gasp of GME? RC isn't your daddy, is he \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bAt $420 a share. I won\u2019t mind paying the premium when I go there to shop in a few months bro.Newegg shoppers need not apply. GME's market will be normies and kids. As it always has been.\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Get fucked. Hope you close that short position ASAP. We\u2019re about to take your milk money and eat your lunch.Honestly it was high quality I might, I'm 37, I have money and I don't have the desire to go through the whole pc part picking experience relearning whats good every 5 years.Imagine being 40 and shitting on people who need a hand buying and putting together their first gaming pc.Your user name does NOT check out. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bGet fucked \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bYou don\u2019t need a degree to understand the \u201ctechnical computer parts required for high end gaming rigs\u201d it\u2019s not a fucking nuclear reactor.Bro who is huge into pc gaming told me same thing - getting High end gaming pc stuff is either online or driving hours to micro center. Having a gme around the block would be game changer for him and others like himI live in Florida and hate how we have nothing close to microcenters here.Just checked and my closest Microcenter is 8 hours away. About the same for Fry\u2019s.\n\nI have 10 GME stores within a 1 hour drive.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I legit didn't even know about microcenter until GME started getting comparisons. Known about Gamestop my whole life. \ud83d\ude80My closest microcenter is over 12 hour driveI bet these pc-building stores are what they planned to talk about at the conference when they switched from retail to tech. \n\nBut for whatever reason they weren\u2019t ready to announce that just yet so they canceled.When can I expect a GME electric vehicle?Other plans you say? When can I expect the rollout of a GME electric vehicle?I'd like a kiosk to build a mouse. Left side panels for buttons, shell configurations for different hand sizes and weights, different plastic slider thingy shapes and sizes, different cords.As long as every component can be RGB, I'm in![deleted]This is true; but additional services (think Best Buy\u2019s Geek Squad for example, or GamePass) are basically pure profit.\n\nSame with accessories, mouse pads, mice, software, fancy lighting. Anything outside of core components.Loss leader but without the loss partno branded micro centers near me if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, and the run down mom and pop shops are not where karen will take georgiepoo to build his $2,000 systemyeah los angeleshttps://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/kyrmto/associates_assembling_pc_for_customer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfknowing all your funko pops and knowing how to properly install any brand of component without shorting or destroying pins are very different level of nerds\n\nedit: and do it without googling it in front of the customerMy line for nerds is if you got bullied in highschool or notLmao thinking pc building is just plugging GPU on a moboI think it's more on the lines of having an intuitive knowledge of compatibility without needing to Google - once the parts are confirmed to work together it's a piece of cakeAh yes but here we are forced to examine the difference in \u201ccan\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d \n\nExample/ How many cats out there changing their own oil? They all *could* they just *dont*LEGO's are for nerds. I figured that out because I'm crushing on one. Who knew nerds could be so hot?You understand the stock price doesn't actually impact the companies results right? The price going up or down does NOT create more or less revenue. It may make it harder for them to issue more shares to raise funds but debt is super cheap right now if they were to need money to grow.\n\n The companies results normally impact the stock price but not always.  It is a loose correlation driven by INVESTORS sentiment and macro events. The economy could tank dragging down the stock price and GME could actually have great sales and their stock could trade flat. It also depends on how other companies are doing.  Gme as an investment is competing with other companies for investor dollars based on return vs risk.added his comment to my OPWe should call more gamestops and see what we can gather. I think Cohen is going to announced as CEO soon.Sometimes I give info to customers who seem \"legit\" the unspoken rule is don't rat put the person who gave you info. I've witnessed firsthand people getting fired over something like this.This confirms the transformation is happening. On-the-ground DD matches your news. I'm convinced. Buying leaps Tuesday open. This will moon within a year for sure.Might also be related to a potential analytics/advertising platform. Found some rumors on twitter.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LbVQgNqNope, just now only has a board seat as of MondayNo, and we don't want him to be. We want him to run for board chairman in June (which should be an uncontested run if he owns 19.9%). CEO answers to the board, but the board chairman answers to no one.Thanks man.I still have fans that were \"supposed\" to be compatible with my build so this is definitely the move for GMEIn my head I see this as a kiosk order that is sent to, say, a regional assembly hub. From there it ships complete either to the store or to your door. Associates in store would be there for advice on component choices, accessories, and upsells such as subscriptions or protection services. \n\nPerhaps the best part of the kiosk is the potential to build in performance estimates and benchmarks for a particular build as you put it together. Estimate graphics settings and framerates and shit like that. The store employee can know almost jack shit about PCs because the kiosk does it for you. Jusy need one guy at corporate that stays on top of it and pushes out updates.\n\nIf it were my business, assembly would be built into the price at the kiosk.Are we sure Cohen is on board with this strategy if it began before he was on the BoD?  I can't see why he wouldn't think it's a great move, but it seems like this is the perfect thing to announce at the conference, and they pulled out.Was about to cal three of the local gamestops but they closed 45 mins ago. On the other hand, theyALL have 4.5+ stars and 200+ reviews, lol.YO RC IS THIS POST TRUE?I hope you don\u2019t get a 3090 then, that shit is a tankMy laptop wants to light on fire when i open chrome soooo.I did a small double take there on your joke. If you live near bears, they really do go through the trash. Kinda like cats. \ud83e\udd2dThis is an underappreciated commentTasty$100 by 2022 is too low for you? You should work for GS!\n\nGeez the hate is real. Okay then, I'm upgrading to $100 by eom Jan. Good enough? No? Wow..okay $100 by eow.Selling puts = bullishHaha no. I\u2019m up big and getting moreMaybe I\u2019m retarded. I think they\u2019ve just left the U.K. for good. \ud83d\ude2d Can\u2019t even shop online now. Oh well, maybe if this squeeze happens I can profit to reopen a U.K. store.\n\nLiterally a week ago it went down so I thought, oh shit, it\u2019s Ryan Cohen.But isn't console gaming *MUCH* bigger in America?\n\nIs it because Americans generally don't care for PC-gaming or that it is not advertised enough?Not a degree, just some expertise - which the average Gamestop employee doesn't have. \n\n\n\"Which one of these graphics cards is best for that new Cyberpunk game, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or the AMD Radeon RX 5700?\"  \n\n\n\"Ummm....I dunno. Wanna buy some Pokemon cards?\"First person experience here. It took me 2 months to get all the parts in my budget. Gamestop is very well positioned if they decide to get into the trade. Also PC building is an addictive hobby. You start as a gamer trying to save some bucks and end up pimping your case. Head over to r/buildapc and r/sffpc to see what kind of community. It would really be a game changer for Gamestop.Not if they don't stock anything though.  I guess I'm not seeing the appeal of walking into a brick and mortar store down the street to use a kiosk to place and order for a part or system that will be shipped to my house.  Isn't that what a website is from home?\n\nNot trying to shit on GME here, I'm literally all in, but them getting rid of toys and candy and shit, and replacing it all with stocked PC parts you can take home that day sounds more appealing to me.As someone that has build a couple computers before (nothing huge but I know the basics) I can assure you that this market is prime for disruption. Pc building isnt that bad actually but most people dont want to get into it and therefore order a pre build computer online. The problem is that there are hundreds of sites and its very confusing for people to decide which specs to pick. Because of this you have a 90% chance to get ripped off. I seriously believe gamestop could be a mini microcenter but not only for pc builders, but for regular gamers too. \nThey could even combine this with their own digital store, like steam/epic games. You can buy digital games, order pc/console accesories, read gameinformer to stay up to date, have special deals for powerup members and buy digital DLCs or order fysical collectibles from games you play a lot. ALL IN ONE APPLICATION. \nI am just thinking out loud here but everytime I read something like this my dick gets hard and my brain is going sicko mode. Sorry for this long, probably stupid comment but im about to increase my buy order for tuesday \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80As long as it\u2019s priced right cause BestBuy and Walmart have a small selection of high tier pc components but they have insane markups that makes it not worth it.Can second this. I have to drive 4 hours to and from of I want to buy something that day. Fucking sucks.I've been fortunate enough that microcenter is only 10 minutes away but I agree, gme being a microcenter for those people who aren't near one would be great. Better yet, maybe Cohen should talk the board into acquiring microcenterYour bro is spot on. I truly miss having a Micro Center and a Fry's Electronics within 50 miles of each other was glorious. They'd price match each other, but MC 95% was the lowest price, but was instantly sold out. Roll to Fry's and buy.\n\nGot my $1.5K monitor for $799 doing just that. \n\nIf another company filled in for the rest of the country they could steal a lot of online business.My nearest microcenter is over 4600 miles away. I live in the USA. I can find a gamestop much easier.Roadmap was likely to change significantly with RC and the new board, so why present information that is already potentially outdated?Would be a game changer to be able to try it out in personWhat do you mean? Like all the DD that has been posted or just this post?This post is pretty well formulated broFancy lighting? Does this mean my new GME rig will be yeet enough to to post to R/battlestations?lmao they are NOT happyexactly, & if you\u2019re paying someone to assemble something you don\u2019t want them saying \u201cuh hang on let me see how you install this.\u201d They need to have that in the noggin.That's not a good comparison i feel.  Changing your oil is a lot different as opposed to building a computer that will give you endless hours of entertainment, plus porn.Companies value is set by share price. Getting shorted to oblivion limits options for credit and other avenues for raising funds in hard times. A very healthy company can be run out of business through shorts especially when something like COVID happens. If GME didn\u2019t have a healthy war chest in March there is a good chance they would be gone today. A company that has been on the decline for about 6 years (revenue) and whose stock is a penny stock. They would have to issue hundreds of millions of shares to raise real money and who\u2019s going to buy them? If anything would cause a sell off. What bank would loan them money? \n\nWhile shorts don\u2019t effect day to day operations it does make bankruptcy more likely.Yes, If the STAKEholders equal the SHAREholders. Just cause Melvin has a share, doesn't mean they have a stake in the company. The future for GME under Cohen is so bright, I gotta put on some shades \ud83d\ude0eCohen has big balls, we know that. He has the power to fuck the shorts and begin the mass genocide of shorts, but will he actually use his power you think? Like are there any ramifications with big banks and financial institutions. If he screws them, will anything come back to haunt him/ any relationships that could be broken or severed?If you do this make a DD with all the information consolidated, a little extra to fuel for the rocket never hurtsShould call and say something like \u201chey so I heard the GameStop in San Diego is going to have PC build stations  by July and I was curious if the one near me in (enter city here) is doing the same?\u201d \n\nI say July because I\u2019m assuming it won\u2019t be that quick and if the sales person knows the real timeline then they may slip up and say something like \u201cthat\u2019s odd, I was only aware that stores will have stations by September\u201dOP add this as an edit on your post. We need this to gain traction and hopefully news networks pick up the \u201crumors\u201d. We need a major catalyst to finish the shorts once in for all and start the squeeze. All of this information needs to spread like wildfire.Board Chairman answers to WSB.I like that idea a lot.  I know building a PC can be daunting for people who aren't very DIY, but this would satisfy them and also be a great place to learn more about the different build components.  I definitely think they'd have to have a regional distribution center because their stores are way too small to physically hold all that inventory.  But if you can offer a gaming PC that's built and either delivered to your door or you pick it up at your local GME store in a short time frame, I think they have a winner. \n\nI went through Cyberpower PC on my latest rig and it took about 5 weeks from order to receiving my gaming PC.  If they can beat that time window they can absolutely start taking market share away from those other companies who build PCs.Maybe, he want to get in first and fulfill his share requirement before this moons.Tweet if it\u2019s true!!Yup they've destroyed mine once or twice !In this bubble? Yeah those aren't great returns.Double negative confuses retards.New product, new training.Plus imagine the used parts market they could offer. Most PC gamers cycle through upgrades before they do a full rebuildIf gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80If gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80Think about someone building their first PC, they are going to be very nervous considering the amount of money being spent and without a friend they trust they may just not do it or make critics mistakes that drive them back to consoles. A pc building kiosk with a employee that actual knows pc parts and can help someone setup a pc that does what they need it to do in their price range is huge.The toys/collectible business is huge for them though, so I wouldn't say they should get rid of that.  Dunno about candy though (cheap but high margin, not sure if worth the shelf space?)If gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80My dick got so hard it got stuck in a pumpkinWhere do you live, fucking Alaska?Sure I\u2019m speaking more to the idea that just cause you can doesn\u2019t mean you do. \nIn short- Connivence is a real part of what/how/why we do thingsStock price on affects their ability to raise money, not day to day operations.I am long.  I have 4200 shares i wrote covered calls on so I do hope it dips next week before it goes to the moon just under $30, I will pay my dumb tax and then back over $40.\n\nI also have about 40 April 15 $15C.He can't do it by directly commenting on company value, but he can definitely do it by rolling out roadmaps and company visions for upcoming service and operating model changes, which I expect to start to popping up in coming weeks.You can just straight up say  I am interested in building my pc at GameStop, do you guys have parts available? Ask if they are 1.0 or 1.5 store if you feel ballsyYeah imagine if he releases another filing on Tuesday showing that he bought the dip on Friday. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf14To be fair my Tim Apple phone spazzed out and typed something un-intelligible.i'd totally sell them my old pc to build a new one every 2 yrsThat's a really good point actually, if they become a reliable source for used pc parts they will change the gameNo, they wouldn't get rid of the knick knacks. Think about it. Some dad's going there specifically to grab parts for his new  gaming build. For that kid, without anything shiny, It might as well be a doctor's visit. Except more boring because he won't even get that visceral thrill of a needle in his vein or the subsequent joy of a lolli pop.\n\nWell at game stop we have life sized pikachus staring down at the dad while he jacks off to the newest i12 processor. The kids distracted by the life sized pikachu's embrace and coos.\n\nSo while the kids blocking it out, dad inseminated the second generation semi organic computer with his genetic code. \n\nA dead, souless eyed wage slave boxes up the inseminated computer. It incubates during the ride home. Assembles itself. The things ready right out of the box, just wipe off its amniotic fluid.\n\nAnd then you insert the Pikachu into the port. The cooing becomes moans. It gets real X rated real quick. Dad uses the opportunity to explain the birds and the bees to little screwy. \n\nWhile screwy's crying for his lost toy, it's growing into his new best friend. And dad's half son.\n\nI say this as a win, win, win. And a bonus too.\n\nKid gets to learn about reproduction in a sterile yet immersive environment. And loss.\n\nDad gets a new computer and has a lot of fun building it.\n\nKid has a new, semi self assembled computer roughly one generation behind his father's.\n\nAnd the pika-computer is sentient enough to love the kid.\n\nBrb, gonna crowdfund  this blockbuster feel good film of the year.\n\n\nEDIT: finished story is on my page, I couldn't link no sleep here. And it might only be chapter one.... LolololololHawaii or Guam for sure.Yes, fucking AlaskaSure, if they don't want to build their own PC.  They can just buy a console, the option will be there.\n\nAll i'm saying is, you are really underestimating the value in empowering retail buyers to be able to build their own desktop at a store in person.  The convenience is there.Good luck fellow autist \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4cAnd by exercising his option to buy more sharesI'm really unrealistically hoping he would drop something like this on Monday to drive pressure on Tuesday. This is a wet dream though and I'm retarded.That\u2019s actually what I believe is the most realistic. Look for a form4 filing.Lol can't wait until gamestop offers me $2 for it like my used games> if they become a reliable source for used pc parts they will change the game\n\ngosh that would be so nice, and to be able to like inspect it in store as well, have had issues with used/refurbished parts being complete duds and having go through the whole tedious replace/return is awfulFucking lol, what the fuck did I just read.Oh oh yeah; totally. \nIt\u2019s a great idea. \nI think there\u2019s a market for sure.Drop it tuesday morning @9:30.

However it's just like everyone still thinks blackberry sells phones and their entrance into the EV market with their software and partnerships with big companies could lead you to believe it's very undervalued. That and all the hype could lead to shorts needing to cover at least temporarily and it could be really lucrative short term.\n\nRegardless of the above, long term they have a lot of fcf from selling their patents and the fb settlement which in turn should quash any possibility of them going bankrupt before something big happens, which is why I think it was so cheap to begin with.Hold on \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Just do thing they tell you and the stonk go up.No this bitch going to 25+ in a very short time your going to be a very happy person.Put your seatbelt on and be ready to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Premium?\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8I will be messaging you in 2 days on [**2021-01-18 23:58:48 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-01-18%2023:58:48%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypduj/bb_call_volume_2200_higher_than_usual_we_did_it/gjirdas/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fkypduj%2Fbb_call_volume_2200_higher_than_usual_we_did_it%2Fgjirdas%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-01-18%2023%3A58%3A48%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20kypduj)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|Sexy fuckerAin\u2019t nothing wrong with that.

Long dated near the money calls on sound companies is about as safe as you can getWhat is your break even? $11 June isn\u2019t too far fetched. But if you paid a ridiculous premium, it might be an impossibility. Just trying to be realistic for you. My autistic ass is sitting on hype juiced 10c 11.5c and 12c. For 1/29.

Not anymore BB!Same as a stock, if a lot of people are trying to buy a certain option, the price will increase even if the value of the underlying remains the same.But is it enough?Easy a 30 dollar stock, easy there EV OS shits on everyone's else.He meant this week guys!!\n\n\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8\ud83d\udef8The ui is sexyIs there a difference between etrade and power etrade?It's OS software shits on everyone else's there is a reason that the companies that are using it have over 60% of the EV market.

Got 50 shares as well, actually feel pretty good about them making a comeback in a new-to-them industry.Break even is 13.90. premium was pretty bad, I bought the dip yesterday.

So it going to be good the stock is going to rise, boomers a just trying to short sell to make it tumble so people sell out then they can buy it all up and make the tendies. We will be fine after the money starts coming back in from EV companies that use their OS and Amazon and Sony develops their EV more which used the OS.Same!Rich? No. Happy?

Pure majestic autism. \n\nI come out of Plato\u2019s cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... \n\nBack in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top \n\nLike a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: \n\n$10k into 3/19 6c\u2019s on the DD that: \u201cwhat are the chances it falls AGAIN there\u201d ... that\u2019s it. \n\nA few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn\u2019t. She went that day.\n\nIn that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5\u2019s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday \n\nSensible thoughts couldn\u2019t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo\u2019s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps \n\nI proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn\u2019t bring myself to watch the stock for a week \n\nI thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold \n\nBut you know what, I remembered it\u2019s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy\u2019s) who cares? \n\nAll is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it\u2019s really fine. Look at what\u2019s happening right now:\n\n1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) \n\nPS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don\u2019t know why yet \n\n2) 1 Billion annual revenue \n\n3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUALLY. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally \n\n(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race \ud83c\udf4e\u2014it\u2019s huge)\n\n4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED \n\n5) VERTICALS GALORE\n\n5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God\u2019s work \n\n6) IOT, AI, smart city\u2019s, insert other buzzwords \n\nI could go on and on, and honestly, I\u2019ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this \n\nMoral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I\u2019ve trimmed half the options, I don\u2019t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I\u2019m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. \n\nWill likely add more if it dips. But...\n\nJust hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette\u2019s syndrome right now... \n\nThis stock has not moved like this for 10 years. \n\nIt might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media \n\nFor fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this \n\nA note on Jim just in case he reads this:\n\nJim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO\u2019s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they\u2019re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company\n\nThe guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally \u201cfree money\u201d \n\nKnow what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. \n\nDiamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands \ud83d\ude4c\n\nTl;dr diamond hand $BB", "score": 1123, "comment": "Thanks for your condolences and advices.

I agree that this volume can't be us. There is however quite a probable explanation: BB came in the media a couple of times with positive news: Amazon partnership (huh wait what BB is in another industry than phones; EV's?!), Patent selling (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones?!), Facebook settlement (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones and has balls of steel?!)\n\nPeople are realising it's no longer the very good phone company that lost market share, it's now the very good company that does cybersecurity and is part of the EV supply chain.You had me at $BB! Got shares and sold some CC's at the top.BlackBerry\u2019s patents alone are worth over $4 billion - about the same as the current market cap. The market has been pricing bankruptcy/irrelevancy for a long time, once growth returns it\u2019ll get assigned some fair multiples and the stock price will be 4-5x what it is right now.More rockets.Best campfire story ever. Doubling my position Tuesday at open. Dont delete the post.I just took a shot of Canada's finest maple syrup for you my fellow autistic friend! \nBB=\ud83c\udf1d Moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80BB isn't your usual one night stand ****. She is marriage material. That's why you need diamonds hands \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50$BB is going to the moon. To everyone who's upset because they \"bought the top\"...when $BB goes to $60+, whether you bought at $9 or $11 is going to become irrelevant. Just buy and hold you cucks. \ud83d\ude0eHolding 4k shares here. Thanks for taking your time to comfort us. You are a good man.Preach. Bought DEEP ITM calls 6/2021 Friday at close cuz IV is bonkersBought 2/19 16c. Is that more reasonable and realistic?1/22 11c reporting for dutyI\u2019ve been involved with BB technology for 15 years now and rode through their mobile demise.\n\nIf you look for analysts comments over the past years you\u2019ll see a trend.  Undervalued.  Lots of cash on hand.  Huge IP buried in their basement.  Government contracts. Industrial/nuclear supply chain.\n\nThen nearly every analyst talks about their phones.  BB exited the phone market like 5 years ago.  That\u2019s an eternity in the phone industry.  The don\u2019t mention that BB tech is already in nearly every other new car on the road, nor do they mention how they\u2019ve been working on car automation for years now.\n\nThey also don\u2019t mention how they have existing relationships and dedicated infrastructure with every cellular carrier in the world, left over from their mobile phones.  Would a dedicated network independent from the internet, certified for DoD use, that could connect to every car in the world with mobile service be useful for the next generation of smart cars?\n\nBB is one of those tech stocks that I bought just to sit on and wait until i was retired, so I don\u2019t have to wash my yacht myself.My gut is telling me this is AMD sub $10 all over again. It was magical seeing AMD climb the way it did from 2016 until now \n\nHope BB follows the same pathI am gonna do YOLO on BB after GME. Already own 200 shares and some options! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Agreed I bought 600 shares at 11.50.

Never again!Thanks op for boosting the confidence. Bought some almost at the top, was afraid to buy more when it dropped on Friday. Might pick up more after reading this \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80BB is the chick you had in highschool with glasses and pimples. No one wanted to fuck her. Neither did you. One day a guy named Jef said \" Damn i havent fked in years...i need some easy pussy\". He walked down the hallway to find his prey. BB accidentally bumped him and her books scattered. Jef looks at her and says \"why the hell not\". BB became popular in one night, throwed away the glasses and let her hair loose. *She was a 10 all along * you thought. You tried to approach her, but now you cant afford her. Ten years later and BB is married to Jeff and she cost more than your 1 bedroom house. And there you are....bald and lonley drinking in a bar at a happy hour thinking why are you so fking retarded. \n\n\nBuy BB BOYS AND HOLD FOR YEARSStay strong brothers. It's getting the attention from bigger players, finally. BB was trying to implement synergies with the Cylance acquisition. People are arguing the CEO has done nothing so far with Cylance. Whoever thinks you can successfully create synergies under 1-2 year without hiccups and burning through some cash is a retarded analyst. Plus the synergies are finally working out, and the hiccups are going away. This is primed for growth. Give it time and it will moon... No it will fucking leave this universe.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Me after reading none of that and seeing a rocket in the title:\n\nYou son of a bitch I'm inYes.

Planning on buying more over the next few months. This stock is definitely undervalued and has serious potential.BB is stuck. Without some kind of public-facing change in marketing it just won't matter.\n\nMy guess is that is what will happen. There will be a major marketing campaign that will shift the way the world sees \"Blackberry\". Most of the people here are thinking \"phone\" because that is what their brand is, and I meant, \"is\", not \"was\", because we still don't have anything else to cling to for the company; they do a lot, sort of like Nokia, but no one knows what they do nor do they care and the world keeps trucking.\n\nThat has to change. I think Chen knows this. We will see.Very nice DD. I\u2019m in for all of those reasons as well, and when I say in I mean ballz fucking deep. And like someone else said, just look at John Chen!

If you want to fuck done shorts this week, then BB is it on them covering that run-up.Hmmm interestingIf you check the GME chart it had near identical movement on Friday. I also suspected something was up. I figured maybe it had to do with the insane option activity on these. I don\u2019t know too much about how market makers work but from my understanding.. as the weekly calls get closer to expiring worthless, the MMs start selling the shares. On top of this, the overall red market, people taking profits, and day trading shorts.Why would someone bleed it before a three day weekend?Unless it goes to the moon right?I sold the 1/29  15c for 1.30 - was a bit later on but still good to average down.and BB didn't grow at all \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Canada's finest1.2 years here; we've certainly had our ups and downs, but things are really good lately \ud83d\ude0cIndeed, I thought like a retard that I bought the top with GME being at 28$, don't do that shitI need in \ud83d\ude80It's actually less risky than holding stock. While it runs the risk of total loss, you get 100 shares of leverage for a lower price. If the stock drops, you're still fucked either way. The only issue is liquidity (sometimes).\n\nIt works better with lower IV, but there's still a benefit.first of all:\n\nif you buy 100 shares it'll cost you 1000$, if you buy the right to 100 shares it cost you 890$, if you end up exercising you pay another 100 $. same price if you actually want the shares but cheaper if you just plan on selling the option.\n\nSecond of all:\n\nOptions prices grow exponentially while stock prices move slowly. essentially for the 1c contract for June, if the price goes down it's no different than buying shares. if the price goes up \\*quickly\\* you'd make a larger profit than holding shares.My mt.

Don't give in to fear and greed and it will be less effective. \n\nI am also a bit cynical so could be my own bias talking.Maybe they knew people would FOMO in hard after the previous days run up. Maybe funds are trolling WSB now and setting bear traps with pump and dumps. IDK .. all I know is they did it to make money.\n\nedit: the fomo would skyrocket seeing the 25% pre-market pump making people think it was the next GME .. worked on me but i'm holding for as long as it takes.BB has been short sold for a while now and they increased volume from 14% to 16% recently. TUTES are at about 53%. Extremely bearish. Options were up on Friday and a lot of puts bought. Shorts are covering this week from that pretty big increase of close to 50% of their volume. Maybe part of the reason.Thats always the \"risk\" when playing theta gang.

The whole point of buying derivatives/leverage (unless a hedge) is to increase your risk-return.While this is true, we need people manning the share pumps too.

Not TSX. \ud83e\udd37Bingo. The only reason they had a bad ER last month was because global auto  production froze in April and May and has remained constrained since then due to COVID supply chain issues and safety regulations, and consequently QNX revenues fell. QNX revenue will return to normal next year, and the growth trend will resume. Cyber Suite is being scaled up and marketed to more customers and IVY will ship in 2022. ARR will keep increasing for the foreseeable future. The current stock price is about 1/2 of what BB should be worth based on their past p/s multiple at roughly this level of revenue in 2005 when they had growth. Once growth returns, this is a $25 stock, easily. Might take a couple years, though. Might even take until 2022 when IVY drops, although if they give us a hint as to what kind of revenue it will bring in, we can price that in and get to $25 a lot sooner. If Chen is smart, he will iron out the financial side of the IVY deal ASAP and start giving projections NOW, because the market conditions for pumping the stock past $30 (he gets a fat bonus check if this happens) have never been better.\n\nIt's all gonna ride on how management communicates. We need IVY revenue projections, we need bullish sales targets for Cyber Suite, and the CEO straight-up saying that the stock is undervalued because it is. Interest rates are low so a debt financed buyback program that buys at any price under $10 might not hurt either and would back up the \"our stock is undervalued\" rhetoric. Combine all that with >10% YoY revenue growth and you have the perfect turnaround story.I dunno man these are the same dudes who will be buying at $20 and sleeping on a good deallooks like your account is a prime example of a pump account.  literally no post history other than shilling BB.  also, you're certainly very adept at reading financials.  congrats on showing data from over a year ago that backs up their last earnings demonstrating they can't make any fucking money.This man is at the roulette table telling you he has a game winning system lmao.The downside risk is total loss of the investment, but it cannot go further than that. If I buy 100 $10 shares, and the bitch collapses to $1 two years later, I'm out $900. If I buy a $5 strike option for $6.00 and it drops to $1, I'm out $600. The downside risk is mitigated. The only place of higher risk is in the $4 to $5 range at expiration.\n\nLEAPS are not roulette.if you buy an option contract. the guy selling you the contract has to buy shares incase you want to exercise the contract.teetering on an ass fucking \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23this is the way my dude. also selling CCPs to take advantage of the insane IVjust buy more, that average will go down!\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80yes I am home now.

Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \\~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***\n\nPLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.\n\nHere's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:\n\n1. CDC\n2. Office of the Secretary\n3. Food and Drug Administration\n4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE\n5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS\n6. National Institute on Drug Abuse\n7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground\n8. Coast Guard / DHS\n9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command\n10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ\n11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS\n\nBoys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.\n\n***UPCOMING EARNINGS***\n\nI've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.\n\n***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nNow, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.\n\nI've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.\n\n***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nSome people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)\n\nIn my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.\n\nThere is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.\n\n***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***\n\nShort answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395\n\nPalantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.\n\nMithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.\n\nProspectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\nI suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.\n\n**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***\n\nFirst of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.\n\nIf you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.\n\nWhether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.\n\nNothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.\n\nPLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***\n\nTo my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:\n\n* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.\n* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.\n\nThere's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \\~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.\n\nWhen those shares are \"unlocked\" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.\n\n>According to [Palantir\u2019s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.\n\nWhat **WILL** affect stock price:\n\n* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.\n* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.\n\n*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*\n\nWhat **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:\n\n* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.\n* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)\n* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.\n* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.\n* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***\n\nImagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.\n\nPalantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.\n\nIt's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.\n\nLiterally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.\n\nWhile this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.\n\ntldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.\n\n**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**\n\nGovernments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.\n\nGovernments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.\n\n**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.\n\nPLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***#8 Other Information***\n\n***\\*\\*Big known PLTR Holders\\*\\****\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a404oalxrob61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2dbcfac5a7ca207127771ec4e3133f8d943359\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR's Price List (2019)\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186](https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Personal TA and Crayon Mania\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR stock pumping events\\*\\****\n\n* 7'th Jan - Interview\n* 26'th Jan - Demonstration\n* 11'th Feb - Earnings\n* \\~15'th Feb - DPO expiration - Havoc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Similar Companies\\*\\****\n\n* PLTR - Palantir - Stock Price \\~$25 - Market Cap 48bln\n* AYX - Alteryx - Stock Price \\~$125 - Market Cap 8bln\n* Semantic Research - Private\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Known Contract Info\\*\\****\n\n* 240 million Palantir Air Force contract expiring soon in 3 months.

I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.\n\nAlso yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.\n\nI've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.\n\nI come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.\n\nMy PT's for PLTR are:\n\n* 48-89 by March or April.\n* 75 - 125 by EOY.\n* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0k1ujprob61.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3a16265edafa290432e6b79f9009e3df99f495", "score": 2196, "comment": "all jokes aside, i did try to read this and it was really informative. thanks for sharing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80I \nAM NOT\nTHROWING AWAY\nMY CALLSI\u2019ve used platanir in the marine school house and that shit was scary good at presenting data in a clear understandable way. No way the government would stop using their system unless someone comes with a better data aggregation. \u201cFirst mover advantage\u201d with the government helps since bureaucracy hates massive change so as long as they continue to integrate with the government systems they locked their future to a certain extentThank you for the time you put into this, this is the content I come here for.  I'm excited to see how this and clean energy ETFs do over the next year Also, \ud83d\ude80.I read the vanity fair article that claims PLTR uses a lot of data anayalst who does the gritty nitty work of extracting the data for it to make sense and its not a lot of automation involved. Can we see if that is true by looking at an expense line? Basically what they are claiming is that as the data sets get bigger and more complex, PLTR is actually losing more money because they require more and more manpower and salary.I can read, and this is great DD. Thanks palWell. This was amazingI don\u2019t understand, can you explain in \ud83d\ude80This was a great DD to start my weekend with, thank you. Bought in at $9.70 because Palantir will eventually be like the pre-cogs in Minority Report or project insight from Captain America Winter Soldier.So to summarize:\n\nP - push off \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\nL - lift off \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\nT - take off \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\nR - rise \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\"I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that  every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million  dollars. \"\n\nR&D expenses are a positive thing. Especially in a tech company. Napkin math time, you say normally 80m a quarter but 300m this time (so 540m tot) their current mkt cap is ~~1.9B~~  44.8 Billion so their PRR is ~~3.5~~. 95. (PRR = MktCap/R&D exp) The lower the PRR the better. Generally 5 - 10 is the sweet spot, so ~~3.5~~ 95 is a ~~growth indicator~~ not enough into R&D, which would explain the increase in the last quarter. \n\nAlso, interestingly Discovery Capital Management has their fingers in it. Robert Citrone co-founded that Hedge Fund and is also the largest minority owner of the Steelers. Makes me wonder if PLTR has thought about licensing their software to the NFL (Think Moneyball guys).\n\nJust some thoughts and opinions. Good DD guy.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nu/spreadsTrader pointed out my screw up with the math, corrections are in the strike outs.Read everything and felt like selling. Wtf? \ud83c\udf11I have friends who work in fed govt, one thing I know unless there is a major screw up they always renew contracts and increase budget by set percentage to adjust inflation every year. That's not just for pltr, its for every god damn thing. Once there is an expense entry in their books, its never going away.\n\nAs to future prospects, pltr got a good footholding because of covid tracing in lot of countries and this will only increase and provide chance to cross sell, up sell.\nThis is an investment stock, not a trading stock.\nPosition: 200 stocks @9.80, not selling for next few years.29/1 $27.5 C loadedGreat DD.   Glad you didn\u2019t mention moon or post any rocket emojisI just wanted to add that despite all these hit pieces and downgrades, the short interest in pltr remains fairly low. If institutions are so bearish on pltr, why don\u2019t they short it? That\u2019s because they are waiting for lockup to expire so they can get cheap shares and they are trying to keep the price down before that.\nAlmost forgot: palantir to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLink: https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4396504-palantir-shorts-are-missingGod, I wish I could read!I love it but would like to add a few things that no one seems to ever mention which I feel is huge. Sandwiched in the investor presentation Palantir mentioned...\n\nThe federal government has a law that they cannot stop use of an entity or service that is to their benefit, to try and create something of their own.\n\nMeaning unless someone else comes along and does Palantir better than Palantir, the government by law cannot replace Palantir. They have to stay with them because it provides them a benefit. Palantir SUED the government for this, and won.\n\nIn my eyes all of the R&D expense is no different than Amazon or Tesla reinvesting in building their foundation.\n\nThis is huge and in my eyes pretty much locks Palantir in to the government. The real combo breaker will be if they can create a new product with a low overhead and lower price point, that can appeal to the masses. Like the Model 3.Thanks for the work mate.\nIn my opinion you have the choice between these options:\n1. Buy under 25 dollar\n2.

Learned a little I didn\u2019t already know.   My question is- if you are this confident, why not get the Jan\u201923 $50 calls?  They will DRAMATICALLY outperform the sharesThis was really well thought out and good DD. I also strongly believe that Q1 earnings will surprise to the upside and will act as the first real catalyst for the stock. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the rise of domestic terrorism further fueling the govt's need for the types of data analytics PLTR specializes in.i like your words magic man, im in, ive always been in2/19 27c checking in I bought at open yesterday down 20 percent already how we lookingupvote for the great Revolut screenshot! and a shitload of money thereYou son of a bitch, I'm inNot enough  \ud83d\ude80 . \n\n1650 shares checking in.This was a detailed and informative read.

I\u2019m a newer investor. I\u2019ve spent most of my time in ETFs and Index funds. \n\nI think the long term aspects of PLTR look good. Short term is questionable depending on lockout. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell from\nmy full fledged retarded view. \n\nI bought 2.5K worth of PLTR stock this past Friday after hearing about it on this sub. Looking at available info on the google machine, I thought it was a good risk as the company is projected to start turning a profit and the lockout and earnings date will hold the price down. Once the lockout/earnings report plays out I think this stock has nowhere to go but up. Too many upsides. You have proven people, expanding niche market that has the chance to go big time tech. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell.\n\nThis is my view as a full fledged autist of course.

Will \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udd90 and add to them for years, for the reasons you\u2019ve stated. \n\nAlso, PLTR has stated that their mission is, in essence, to support Western ideals and democracies; they won\u2019t do business, e.g., with China. \n\nI wonder if that plays a role in the fearmongering about this great company (eg, if you\u2019re support PLTR, you\u2019re a racist/fascist/etc.)Great write up. Reading about PLTR's a rabbit hole kinda deal, I love it. To the moon  \ud83d\ude80Great read thanks.bought PLTR calls yesterday at the top. lets fucking go bois I AM NOT THROWING AWAY MY CALLSYou are missing intelligence community as a customer.  Im sure there are deals that cannot be reported in the books.Other similar companies:  \nIBM 114bn\n\nDatabricks 6bn\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLTR by your EOY estimation has the same market value as IBM or higher. Over 10 times higher maketcap than more similar companies like Databricks(arguably waaaaay more successful, not IPO'd yet).This is great great DD. My one question is how does the dual class stock play into stock valuation when common shareholders basically have no voting rights? I\u2019m all in on Palantir, but this is literally my only concern.!RemindMe! 1 monthI'm in on PLTR and I think I'll up my stake next week. This company can only grow, with Thiel and Karp as founders/directors that is a green light to invest. \n\nQuestion on Revolut: what's your experience on their service and can you trade options?100% appreciate this, I\u2019m a small bag holder on PLTR. Unbiased advice here with both a good upside and some cons.You fucking legend. Thank you so much for this great effort!Give TLDR. Can't read.wow towards the end when OP says losing sleep over it, going full schizzo after going all in; felt that. im not all in, i have a regular position for my port but i hope youre right cadetYou\u2019re explanation of what $PLTR can do for clients made me think of Jack Bauer in 24. If that show taught us anything it\u2019s that CTU can\u2019t lose. So in short, $PLTR is Jack Bauer. This means I\u2019m buying more $PLTR. Thank you for the research and your take on it all. And thanks in advance for the trip to Mars! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Excellent DD. Thank you for sharing that.\n\nThe market is searching for validation to buy. At large corporations, funds, etc., individuals and teams don\u2019t want to make moves with the risk of being considered a moron and getting fired. Buying into PLTR as an institution right now could label you a moron if analysts from big research houses like Citi are right and it goes to $15-20. Then you\u2019re the guy/gal or desk who bought PLTR for your fund / pension / whatever when everyone was calling PT at $15 and it went to $15.\n\nRight now we have company employees and ownership (locked up), hedge funds, early investors and retail investors in. Then you have the idiots who think the real PT is $15 pushing it down.\n\nSo, the kind of buyers that make prices move big time are not in yet. If they were the stock would be well over $50. We need earnings to validate that move. Everything you said about the one-time compensation expenses is spot on. I see R&D as bullish - when companies have massive market opportunity, R&D goes up. Leadership is excellent.\n\nDisclaimer: currently sitting on a 143.52% return already because I bought in the day of the direct listing. Avg cost $10.64.Pump it upAwesome effort. I\u2019m holding my PLTR for the long term and buying the dips anyway but its nice to see someone put this effort in. Not expecting it to hit Saturn but reckon it will be a great long term optionAre Shares or leaps the play here?Good DD but I don't know. With the CC's I've been selling I've reduced my cost basis to around $15.70 on 5,500 shares. I'd like to see this thing at least touch all time highs again before I decide to sell out. I believe in the company but this is off to a rough start with wallstreets vendetta against it. Lots of other great plays happening around me but my money has been tied up in sideways action now for months. We'll see what happens after lockup before I decide how long I'm going to hold.Thanks for the thoughtful post. Your time and effort are appreciated.\n\nI have mixed feelings on Alteryx being called a direct competitor. \nAlteryx helps analysts put different data sources together more easily but they are still on their own when creating insights. It seems like PLTR does the technical implementation so analysts can focus on the analysis 100%.\n\nIt might just be nuance for some, but to me that is the sole differentiator and what makes PLTR unique. *Thoughts?*\n\nI have a similar horizon of ~1yr and I'm long shares and leaps.Upvote for explaining how the governments work. I work for local government in the UK and they can barely create an internal HR system to view and book holiday on.\nWhen they do create stuff it takes an age and all the decision makers are dusty old boomers in ill fitting suits from the 80s.\nPLTR can do exactly what they want in 1/10 of the time and 10x better - they have a massive market to capitalise on.\nI\u2019ve been slowly moving my portfolio over to PLTR since Christmas. I think it\u2019s now time to go balls deep \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Good analysis, thanks. I am a former investment banker and current private equity investor. I\u2019m not sure I fully agree with your financial analysis in the third bullet, but I\u2019m too lazy to DD this myself and do more research.

Took me almost 20 seconds to swipe to the commentsI remember people saying \u201chow could you invest in PLTR when you know Soros is invested in it\u201d. Yah, fuck Soros, but I remember seeing a clip where he said he was already out of PLTR. \n\nAnything you Google about it says \u201cSoros can\u2019t wait to offload his shares of PLTR\u201d, but I swear I saw a video of him saying \u201cI\u2019m not sure why people are saying that, I currently have no holdings in PLTR\u201d.

Well already holding a position but now im going all in \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80a fellow revolut usercan this be the PLTR equivalent of u/deepf\\*invalue?Thank you for the DDThere's a super in depth DD of PLTR on Seeking Alpha titled \"Palantir: Parallels With Microsoft, Potential Network Effects Underappreciated\" that I would recommend if you're all in. I didn't paste the link because i think SA links are banned here. Has a price target of $47 by 2022.\n\nI've been a screeching PLTR fanboy since a bit before the first public earnings report and I agree that this company is still undervalued in comparison to other SaaS and data management/analytics companies. However, I do think that the increasing politicization of PLTR should not be ignored given PLTR's dedication to serving the US and the current state of US politics. AOC has criticized PLTR for it's contracts with ICE and the unfortunate consequences of the insights PLTR provided to ICE agents. It's often discussed here that Obama and Joe like surveillance which PLTR allegedly assists with and can/does face criticism from representatives from both parties who are more privacy-focused. \n\nThese things are more of a testament to how good their software is than anything, but it's clear now more than ever that other business (potential clients) have no problem disassociating themselves from highly politicized firms so that they don't end up in the spotlight as well. To be honest, I hope that PLTR makes Foundry a separate company that is still owned by PLTR (think Alphabet vs Google) so that their political work doesn't affect their commercial brand.\n\nTLDR: PLTR \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ugh. Another post by someone who has been on Reddit for less than a year. Why would I believe this. Also, literally the only thing this account posts about if PLTR.We can't of course not really evaluate the connection to trump. Thats another factor why you can't accurately predict howfundamentally this company will do in this year.   \ne their products, because they aren't available to public and nobody really knows how they work (at least i didn't find something) (which is also resulting in an outcry from rightwatch groups for months)   \nagencies\n\nAlso, it looks like they profited hugely because of trump. Alex Karp is somehow connected to trump, even before his presidency even begun. I think it aint a coincidence that PLTR grows if the government pushes them.   \n\n\nBefore trump PLTR also lost contracts with NSA for example. They have a good or bad product but not everyone is satisfied and i find it hard to really evaluate their products, because they aren't available to public and nobody really knows how they work (at least i didn't find something) (which is also resulting in an outcry from civil-right-watch groups for months)   \nagencies\n\nOf course, Biden won't push PLTR away if it does work. But it does seem like a huge gamble to me. If the contracts don't get a renewal, then this company is in serious trouble.  \n\n\nWe can't of course not really evaluate the connection to trump. Thats another factor why you can't accurately predict how fundamentally this company will do in this year.   \n\n\nWe don't know how much trumps connection with Alex did something and how much force there was for the agencies to use PLTR instead of another competitor it could be that under Biden this pressure, if it was necessary isn't existing anymore and then you are will see all these contracts expiring and the company isn't yet profitable?  \n\n\n**Don't get me wrong:** It seems like a nice stock, but a one with heavy gambling. Or i got something fundamentally wrong and can't read us-balance-sheetsVery in depth and valuable information here. Thank you. More posts like this on this sub!!TLDR; motherfucker do you speak it?!I have come a across of pltr as part of my day job. What they sell is a bitemporal data built on a sql database. That is what pltr sells and honestly that is not a difficult problem to solve. They managed to win  govt contracts because of Peter theil's connections with trump. They literally given up on their product for financial institutions because the clients figured out that pltr adds no value. Best of luck pumping a low margin IT consultancy business.The hero we needed>PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks.

How big realistically do you think their market cap could go? 48 Billion already at a stock price around $25, is it going to be a trillion dollar company? If so how?  \n\nAlso  \ud83d\ude80\"I come from it so I know\"\n\nBlah blah blah who gives a fuck. There's millions of you. \n\n\nPT by eoy north of 100 is severely stupid. You think this is a 200B company as it stands? NoThis fucking retard has $250k of PLTR on Revolut.

Why does that matter because of cost of delivery. They\u2019re a bespoke packaged software house.\n\n * Each software solution they sale must be customized and professional services involved. In essence they are a consultancy.\n\nWhy this matter _against_ the bull thesis? Because they won\u2019t be able to grow at the multiple at which it stands. The multiple it\u2019s currently enjoying is hype, mono, etc. but unlike other software companies they won\u2019t be able to grow at the clip the shares are priced at.\n\nIn your comparison, you compare it to Alteryx, and plantir has a 6X larger market cap with only a small fraction of the revenues.\n\nTL;DR: incomplete analysis leads to errors in conclusion.TL;DR; PltR $30 bY 12/31 oR I eAT mY LeFt TeSTicLe LiVe ON tWiTCh!\n\nYeah I'm still bitter.

Sure the company seems great but the financials just do not back the current value. \n\nI wish you autists the best and hope it works out for ya but it doesn't make any sense to me. How can $BB not be extremely undervalued in cybersecuruty with $PLTR at it's current price?Wow this is incredible. We all owe this man a debt of gratitude.So what you\u2019re saying is my 1/22 28c are doomed.Sorry bro. We first take on GME, then we can go after PLTR. We are at war right now and all money just be redirected to GME frontline#7 I would blow my GFs lover for that ability at my work.You have just convinced me to short PLTR around earnings time.#9. More gains in GME.A classic case of enough biased words makes a bad position seem plausible.\n\nFunny thing is, I was toying with the idea of doing DD on PLTR for a post this weekend titled \"PLTR doesn't love you anymore and hasn't since Thanksgiving\".  But then I decided I'd rather go snowmobiling.\n\nThe short reply to your novel here is that they're trading at too high a multiplier relative to their peers, the incoming administration is going to take money from government arms that would use PLTR and reallocate it in their quest to send our tax dollars to other nations so those nations can get free solar powered roads and bird guillotines, their balance sheet is a bit of a mess, and they've got too much activist investor attention.  Oh, and they're too reliant on a client (the government) which is slow on contracts and about to inflate our dollars to worthlessness, which devalues the contracts, but won't be able to make up for that elsewhere\n\nSources not provided because I'm a lazy fuck who doesn't love you, either.\n\nTL:DR: PLTR gang is just 2021 version of MU gang: so caught up on why it should be \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and who are going to spend years screaming about how it doesn't make sense why it's not happening.If the likes of Google and Facebook don't need it because they can develop their own, why does the US government need it? They love to hire contractors to build their own unique systems as opposed to buying a COTS solution like PLTR.Ban for trying to get us to read all of thatCongratulations on not mentioning Biden or Russia one time.  \n\nPalantir is about to get relegated to the dustbin of history.  They have no moat.  They have no contracts.  These dudes are just cutting an enormous paycheck at your expense.\n\nThis is a murky investment and it won\u2019t get any clearer because that would only bring the stock down.  Some insider is going to buy a few million shares and you are going to just shit yourself with excitement.\n\nThe flat out truth is not only is Palantir garbage, but it\u2019s easier to make your money elsewhere in the market.  Short term it\u2019s lost its appeal.  And it\u2019s *definitely* easier to make long money than parking it in this retarded investment.I also tried to read it. If only I could read.I scrolled through the whole thing to reach the comments. That shit is long bro.I need instructions on how to scroll here. Or I think my scroll button is broken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAMAZING WRITE UP. MAD RESPECTI'm young scrappy and hungryEyyyy mah man :)RISE UPWhat clean energy ETF are we buying???I think people also forget that the ancillary purpose of government contracting @ DoD is to fund the next generation of tech during the valley between \"innovative new idea\" and \"broadly viable on the commercial market\".  For new tech, the value of those government contracts is gargantuan. If PLTR figures their shit out (which is *the* bet, IMO) and becomes huge in corporate america...5 or 10 years out, 25 dollars/share will seem insanely undervalued.**platanir**Companies like Palantir are pros at digging their claws into companies.  It's gets to the point where they'll be so ingrained no one will even know how to get them out.Capitalize that M killer.There are plenty of good competitors in that space -\\_-Which clean energy ETFs are you looking at besides ICLN and TAN?>Thank you for the time you put into this, this is the content I come here for.  I'm excited to see how this and clean energy ETFs do over the next year Also, \ud83d\ude80.\n\nI like QCLN.I would like an answer to this as well.They released a software that reduces the installation time by half and manpower needed to go on location as well. Over time when they have enough data on certain sectors they can probably cut off sending the manpower completely. The reason they have to send ao many engineers is that they customise it to the clients needs. The engineers therefore are actually learning the workflow of the company over months and catering custom functions. \n\nSay once the company knows the ins and outs of a huge airline company then they can more or less reduce the installation time on their next airline client and send out lesser amount of engineers. In the long run this can be seen as gathering field data to build their own efficiency so the money they spend on engineers out is actually research for them>PLTR uses a lot of data anayalst who does the gritty nitty work of extracting the data\n\nWelcome to ANY data platform.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"AI\" that works out of the box.  You will always need data scientists for this sort of thing.\n\nThere is likely economy of scale here tho, the more data sets the more common functions you can build.  I.e. find a data source in one gov org that exists in another then you only build the model once, find that again in another 5 agencies and you simply redeploy the model, made adaptations to one, and it applies to them all.  It's all about the data.\n\nWhether or not they're losing money on data scientists is a different discussion.  I find this hard to believe, maybe a loss leader for some clients, but as someone who sells data platforms, consulting, and integration, you just add margin to resource cost or blend it with software/services.A quick scan of their Q3 2020 income statement backs the claim that they are spending a lot more on R&D expenses and just operating expense in general as they are growing.\n\nAbout a 13% increase in revenue from the prior quarter. I didn't compare their actual Q2 revenue, I just divided their revenue as of Sept 2020 by 3 to estimate a Q2 revenue number.\n\nQ3 2020: R&D is 108% of revenue\n\nYTD 2020: R&D is 61% of revenue\n\nTotal Operating Expenses for Q3 2020 is 341% of revenue\n\nTotal Operating Expenses YTD 2020 is 195% of revenue\n\nIt's not abnormal for a company to spend more on operations as they grow but these are numbers that I would want to consider.\n\nWas trying to find a breakdown of their operating expenses but didn't find one.You could go look at their income statement, and see if their are any notes attached re: their wage expense. Also maybe correlate years of higher expenses with contracts signed with more complex customers?From what I understand, Pltr licenses the software, and the AI aggregates and presents huge swaths of company data in a tangible manner in which our human brains can understand. The AI scales itself with data, and in the process human capital more efficient, which saves companies crap tons of money and manpower, the value in doing that makes pltr money. Pltr develops the AI with engineers and data analysts/scientists.This is true and a significant threat to how they scale (not very well). It takes data science experts and domain experts to partner with these companies data to tailor make these experiences. Its basically like IBM Watson in that regard.\n\nThese knowledge engines aren't magic, and all voodoo AI or something. Palantir has been hemorraging money in operating expenses largely due to the nature of how they are setup (you think they'd have gone public if things were peachy in their shadow ops with the gov?)\n\nFurther, there is a major risk of impact due to data regulation with the companies they partner with.\n\nFrom their own website on GDPR:\n\"Foundry\u2019s flexible data protection capabilities are helping organizations prepare for an ever-evolving global regulatory environment, from the GDPR to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and beyond.\"\nhttps://www.palantir.com/solutions/gdpr/\n\nAnd beyond is a key phrase here. More is coming, and they regularly acknowledge this.\n\nParticularly after the last year, and violent extremists on social media platforms. Big data companies that have been ruthlessly exploiting the public data will feel the pain with a Democrat controlled congress and this has bipartisan support regardless.\n\nThe downstream of that will impact analytics companies like PLTR. They probably won't be crushed by this alone but any opportunities it presents are far outweighed by the risks.\n\nThis is a major reason they've been desperately trying to diversify into other areas, but its largely small potatoes when most of their revenue still comes from the feds. Their software is not cheap, so if youre not getting the ROI... bye! (I.e. post-covid)\n\nGoogle and FB are currently in the cross hairs for antitrust, but its inevitable data regulation will continue to be a major threat to large tech.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake.\n\n\"We strive to contextualize major world problems and think critically about whether it's possible to engineer complementary solutions in an ethically responsible way. When the answer is no, we turn the opportunity down.\" https://www.palantir.com/pcl/\n\nWhen the answer is \"no\". Yep, totally ethical and cool. \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo if the answer is kill the terrorist along with 10 children or the bus driver with 20 children and 2 terrorists, based on some twitter/FB/insta data and correlating that with those hacked emails/comms/dragnet collection from the nation state government theyre partnering with is the answer for them \"no\" or... hmm let's talk with your experts and figure out the details. And what made this person a terrorist? Who defines the label? He was a MAGA terrorist! No he was an Antifa terrorist!\n\nI'm sure there's no grey areas when dealing with ICE or Afghanistan/other Middle Eastern countries, or the police forces of America which are also super ethical, right? \n\nFWIW I am absolutely biased against them if that hasn't been made clear. I have vehemently disliked them since 2014 and will shit on them whenever the chance arises. I don't support companies that are effectively super powering the dragnet collection against entire populations of people with 0 transparency or oversight and abetting companies/governments in committing human rights violations. I suspect many others share a similar sentiment with me.\n\nTl;dr Best of luck to you that are on this FOMO \ud83d\ude80> gritty nittyI guess you could take a look at their open positions (what kind of profiles they're looking to fill in their payroll). You would expect to see a lot of Data Science / AI profiles, and some  senior ones in order to develop those automation algorithms.That sounds like a really shitty process.In their investment day videos they said their rollout costs have greatly reduced and they are able to set up their software much quicker than they used to. \n\nI guess it will always take a bit of work as it will be custom for each company, but it looks like one of their goals is to significantly reduce that cost, and they are succeeding in that. They do the whole rollout for free, which is a huge plus for potential customers.There is no fucking way they have people going through most of the dataRight, same here. Red flags when determine purchase is if they add some kind of dedicated support really cheap, which to me means, \"you can't use this product we will use it for you\".Every sentence just looked like this to me.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80PLTR \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Thiel \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I AM NOT THROWING AWAY MY CALLS \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I scrolled all the way down and this was the first \ud83d\ude80 I saw.

I wish Karp would put my head to rest on this somehow.\n\nI hope it's real R&D cost and not money spent on a non optimized process that will simply bloat and grow forever...>) their current mkt cap is 1.9B so their PRR is 3.5. (PRR = MktCap/R&D exp) \n\numm, why did you use 1.9B when it's 44.67BPeople would rather see 1000 bad sales guys with a 3 month average turnover than good R&D that will give the 10 big hitters the ability to close dealsI too felt a large discrepancy between the overall read and the 10x in 1 year price target lolThis. I'm glad I'm not the only one. A lot more negative potential than positive potential in the short run and maybe long run. Sure, the one time cost of listing and compensation was only for last quarter, but where is the growth coming from? He stated ~500mil growth needs to be maintained to break even in the upcoming years. Will the US government allow PLTR to sell to other countries? If this Tech is our advantage, why would we allow them to sell to other countries?\n\nThe dilemma would be PLTR hooking up with another Govs. We would threaten to pull out and use another company. It all comes down to if it's worth it for PLTR to lose the US contracts for outside growth. Let's play chicken. Who has the power in this scenario. I'm too retarded to understand the psyche on this and the maths on the opportunity cost for both parties. Anyways,\n\n5 PLTR 35c Jan 21 '22\n5 PLTR 26.5c Feb 12 '21I sold last week to lock in some profit; the resistance to $30 pricing and the dpo unlock has me a little shook.

They\u2019ll just keep giving money for upgrades/renewals. Palantir is set for decades with gov\u2019t contracts alone.\n\nFor growth, investors just want to see if they are able to scale in the commercial side because that\u2019s where the money is.\n\nNow they\u2019re public, people will know more what they do so I think Palantir is just getting started.Yea, if it's not getting axed after the pilot phase it's not getting axed ever.30 contracts deep $35c 2/19.\n\nedit: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80The politically motivated hit pieces are the funniest.

Thank you for that.Palantir doesn't directly handle any of their customers data. They just set it up in a way that makes it much easier to process for the customer themselves.I disagree with your assessment of their role in prosecuting terrorists, but other comments have addressed this.\n\nRegarding the regulatory environment, I actually see this as a pro.  I work at one of the major software companies.  PLTR\u2019s data tagging, access model and data source transparency remind me of the GDPR modernization we went through a few years ago, but better implemented.  PLTR\u2019s software is capable of automatically tagging and associating various data fragments as a single customer, and if that customer requests all data a company has on them or asks for that data to be deleted (as are core responsibilities of companies under GDPR), having such a unified view is a huge advantage in enforcing these regulatory mandates.> FWIW I am absolutely biased against them\n\nSays it all right here.I briefly dated one of their senior SWEs a few yrs ago. Suffice it to say, the stories I heard about their business dealings turned my stomach. Fuck PLTR.

PLTR looks strong as fuck for the long-term.This.  Take whatever Barrons and Seeking Alpha is saying and inverse them.  The fact is that they are paid shills.  People only pay shills when it benefits them and makes them profit.  The market being an oppositional establishment in nature, means you generally do the *opposite* of what paid shills tell you to do.this. A lot of these Authors are just trying to get you to subscribe to their service or get views. they go from one stock to the next. they have no skin in the game. it's no different than Shannon Sharpe criticizing a basketball player, a sport he has no expertise in. he is paid to give a strong opinion and create buzz and generate views and clicks. always do your own DD and use everything else as supplemental info.You are out of your mind if you think this will be 200+ any time soon.  That would put it valued atca market cap of around 300 billion.  That is just silly.You gotta spend money to make money.I used to work in R&D. Burning money produces real world data, and data is valuable. It\u2019s a good sign when those costs go up. \n\nIn palantir\u2019s case, they have defense contracts. If those costs go up, that means they are producing results, and the clients are further pushing for growth and progress on previous projects to be continued. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16Shit. good catch, just woke up. Had plugged number of shares instead of cap. that changes thingsI was wondering the same thing..The amount of money the founders make, and the fact that the one guy hired his wife straight into the company scare the shit out of me.Read a few articles weeks ago, they seem to already have been partnering with other governments recently, greece's covid response plan, Japan/Fujitsu contracts, but I'm just as retarded as everyone else on here... 120 PLTR shares @ 26.14They land contracts with other govt too. Last time I remember it was GreeceThis is not the way.This is the way.\n\ud83d\ude80Same but 33c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80The stratosphere is very flavorfulThat\u2019s gangsterSo my Investment Strategy is based on herd mentality inspired by manics and maniacs. Nice.You think it'll go down towards earnings then up after then?\n\nSaw some posts on PCG a month or so back, may re-read and have a look myself\n\nCongrats on the GME tendies!I\u2019ll answer: it\u2019s because share lockup ends in Feb. and previously unsellable shares will hit the market. \n\nRemember me when you hit a mill and buy me a used Kia.I\u2019ll try to help.  LEAPs both make millionaires and destroy wealth.   The far OTM calls are often called LEAPs.  (Look it up).  The Jan\u201923 $50 Calls are about $7-9 a piece (amplified by 100).  One call = $700-900 to buy.\n\nThey are $50 strike in my example.  They are \u201cOTM\u201d out of the money, very far out of the money in fact because PPS is only $25 right now.\nLets say you pay $9.  By the expiration date in Jan 2023 you need the share price to be a MINIMUM of $59 just to break even- because the calls will be worth approximately their intrinsic value on expiration day.  \n\nFor every amount over $50 on the day of expiration the contract value will grow.\n\nIf the PPS is $75 on day of expiration the contract will be worth $25.  You paid $9.  You made almost 3x.   Meanwhile if you bought shares today for comparison you\u2019d make about 3x (75 / 25 = 3x)...  around $75 PPS the share and calls perform similarly...\n\nNOW let\u2019s say he is right (he\u2019s not, it\u2019s overzealous but only by a little...) and the share price is well into the $100\u2019s; let\u2019s say $150.\nIf he bought shares today that\u2019s a 6x gain.... but if he bought the Jan\u201923 contracts they\u2019ll be worth approximately $100 per contract ($150-50 = $100 intrinsic value on day of expiration). He only paid $9 per contract.  So that\u2019s an 11x on calls versus the \u201cmere\u201d 6x.\n\nAnd this is all using the day of expiration and intrinsic value only as examples.  The calls can outperform the shares much faster due to inefficiencies, liquidity, and \u201cGreeks\u201d.\n\nWhen you see some of the market made millionaires they\u2019re often because of LEAPs- far OTM calls on high conviction plays.\n\nI think PLTR will be $60-80 by EOY \u201821 and $120-160 by EOY \u201822 potentially with some wild fluctuations along the way.  I think the revenue and profitability will surge and WS will cave after 1-4 more blowout earnings and start rating it appropriately.  For this reason it is also essentially my all-in as well with about $550k including $200k worth of you guessed it- the Jan\u201923 $50 calls.Ok thanksStrike?Trying to be realistic. There\u2019s no short squeeze.Widely used. Partners with Azure and AWS.\n\nH&M, Zalando, Shell, Exxon, AstraZeneca, bp, T-Mobile....\n\nIn terms of government contracts they are probably on par with $PLTR.Databricks is a cloud computing PaaS.  It abstracts away having to work with AWS. Palantir is (like OP said) a glorified dashboarding platform.I get you ahahahaTo be fair, in what industry isn\u2019t there competition?\n\nThis is an extremely sticky space in terms of clientele. Once a contract has been landed, what incentives do governments and enterprises have to replace or build the solutions Palantir is offering themselves? I have a hard time believing the budget would be allocated.\n\nGiven that Palantir is ahead of the game in their product offering, having inroads into governments and enterprise customers could open up more sales opportunities down the line.\n\nSo then it comes down to what you believe the market opportunity isThere already is competition in this space. Like another poster said once Palantir gets its claws in you you're on the PLTR ride for the rest of your life.  This market is literally driven by boomer upper/middle managers who want to invest in \"data\" .  This worked for Tableau after their 2016 collapse.  Palantir is like Tableau but with a technical consulting wing and an already established base of government contracts.  \n\nMid-term they at worst move sideways. Long term it depends on future product lines.  I can easily see them challenging Salesforce's crusty ass CRM or acquiring a smaller \"data\" startup and bringing it into their offering.The premium I receive for selling the covered calls can mathematically be removed from my overall cost basis. You then re-divide that by the amount of shares you own and you get your adjusted cost basis.[removed]Yes. And I\u2019m drunk. Fuck her.Can't tell if retard or idiot \ud83e\udd14Yeah, reading this DD made me less excited to hang on to this stock. Been uneasy since1-that link to license costs is not broken - my mistake.\n\n2-Palantir has customers from a number of sectors. To identify oil only is w-r-o-n-g.What\u2019s a scare piece? I\u2019m a software engineer and have worked in software consultancies in my decade-plus career.Does BB not do private cybersecurity consulting work now? I was under the impression that they had segwayed into that market besides their suites.Nah. It's a solid company. I haven't spent as much time as OP on the fundamentals but I love the ethos of the company and I love Karp. I've watched a lot of interviews with him and read a fair amount about him. I've also read about the work environment and am convinced they will continue to attract the best talent.I know they blow but they still do it. I haven't seen them transition to wising up and using COTS software but I would like to see it.Really have my doubts about Cathie in 2021No I bought PLTR at 11 and sold at 27.  I get my kicks clowning bagholders.I'm just looking for the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80My pleasure! Thanks for alluding to it <3Apparently haha I hope it sticksWhy so far out?Looks like three to meThank you! I\u2019ve got some LIT and also BATT>CTEC\n\nThank you, did not know about this one! I'll check it out!That's cute, but you have 0 clue what you're talking about. If you're relying on Palantir to save you, you should lay off the drugs.\n\nUS Cyber Command and our intelligence apparatus are one of the most effective entities on the planet, and has no qualms about being unethical in the pursuit of their mission.\n\nAnd China is going to have an internal crisis on its hands before it ever overtakes the US. You think inequality is bad in the US? PRC doesn't have as much support as they'd want you to believe.So in other words, palantir does no oversight because its the responsibility of their customer? Which is exactly the opposite of what they state.\n\nWhile it would be nice to believe the rosy picture you paint, they aren't transparent. You can lie to yourself if that makes you feel better about your investment though.\n\nI strongly doubt they'll exist in 10 years but feel free to ride the meme wave or wherever people think this is going.Don't get me wrong, I think data processing and privacy regulation is big business in the future for some companies. I just don't think anyone will pay PLTR to do it, or will want to be associated with them outside of their tiny niche they've carved out.\n\nFrankly if you think their operations with the domestic or foreign military organizations are ethical, I got a bridge to sell you. They are facilitating the analysis of large scale dragnet collection of civilians of various middle eastern and Asian countries.\n\nAnd these operators I'm sure have a good track record of ethics and concern for human rights... or not.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/trump-afghanistan-airstrikes-increased-civilian-deaths-by-330-since-2016-2020-12\n\nNot that I give Obama a pass either.\n\nSnowflake /AWS /Salesforce and every other big data company will eventually eat their lunch with the continued AI innovations with unstructured/semi structured data will make their business model obsolete (they'll scramble to adapt and start hemmoraging all of their incredibly expensive talent).Username does NOT check out.Damn I just got in on PLTR this week, are they basically a shady CIA data company? What that ex-employee say, if you don't mind?This is the way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Palantir is 18 years old. Not saying they shouldn't be targeting growth but idk if Id call them a startupWith all that\u2019s happened with GME, you can see those fuckers writing hit pieces to help contain the price. It\u2019s so obvious. The wording they use is clearly to scare people - it\u2019s not fair or neutral at all. They are paid to say a certain thing. Motley fool, Barron\u2019s, seeking alpha - if they\u2019re so smart about investing why are they writing articles instead opening up a proprietary trading fund themselves? \n\nOh it\u2019s because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re soingZM market cap is currently over 110 billion, it was over 170 billion at some point last year. Their 2020 revenue is barely double of current PLTR revenue. Go figure\"You are out of your mind if you think GME will be over $15 and time soon\"\n\nI agree with you but I have learned in the last year nothing works how it used to and stock jumps do not happen because of fundamentals anymore.\n\nAnything can happen in the Matrix.\"you are out of your mind to think Tesla will be 100+ this year\"\n\nBlah blah blah, heard it all before. \ud83d\ude80I think it can be but it will need a couple more years for that.I\u2019m selling when he brings on his wife\u2019s boyfriend.It only scares you because you don't know this or worse is going on in literally every company this size.That guy's wife is a Stanford IT graduate though. So, it's not like she's just there for the paycheck.Someone\u2019s gotta make the coffeeYou think its not common in corporate life?They seem willing to work with anyone except the traditional enemies of the west. They're basically going to take contracts from anyone but China and parts of EMEATl;dr \ud83d\ude80That'll be ITM for sure bro!!Climb into earnings, I would sell the day before, buy back later after lockup.\n\nRe pcg. Energy /utilities is a possible benefactor of a rotation. They have their fire insurance safety certificates now. They are looking at solar and batteries and are cheap af. Likely not a very exciting play but I bought in a $10 and I'm thinking about growing it now in the less retarded part of my holdings. GME was great I was glued to the sp for 3 days 7 bagger!Thank you so much for such an in depth response! Really appreciate it.Wondering if I should just buy a LEAP instead of shares to free up capital.\n\nI try not to by options anymore after getting burned by them200k calls at that strike you fucking hero!\n\nI wanna see this gain porn in 2 years\n\n!remindme 2 yearsCop shares too, buy it up.

Usernames are like actual names. They don\u2019t matter.Palantir is Big Brother confirmedTo tech communities I've been in:\n - optimised for growth and change = startup\n - optimised for profit and stability = business\n\nPLTR seems somewhere in between the two now.  Still chasing growth pretty aggressively, but compromising with some profitability too.\n\nOn the other hand, there's often an extra condition for \"startup\" which is that it must be privately held, so I guess by my own usual metrics they aren't a startup any more.Find a successful stock. Build its timeline. Cross reference that with articles Motley Fool has written about the company. \n\nSee for yourself they have no fucking idea what they\u2019re talking about.Exactly, there are companies with market cap of 10x their revenue.You guys have been trying to pump PLTR for months, it's over.Yeah but it also scares me because I'm in 25k, rollin heavyAnd government... As seen in recent US politics.IT is IT, does it matter that it came from Stanford? Maybe. I just think nepotism is a terrible business model to haveThink about it, wife = $200k a year. Wife provides coffee, food, and blowjobs. Its easy to find an employee that will provide you with food and coffee, and its easy to find an employee that provides you with blowjobs, but its hard to find one that does all three. \n\nIf the wife wasn't involved, you'd need a chef/secretary which will run you about 50k a year, and you'd need a hooker for about 150k a year (blue chips only for Karp), so the cost is the same as hiring your wife. But now if you want to eat caviar while getting your dick sucked, you'd have to talk to two people not just one.And tendies lolThanks for the help / info! Just getting started in this stuff so trying to understand the research behind all the moves if anything (not expecting to make money at all, perfectly happy to lose it all learning) - any resources you'd recommend for fairly new people?Are you saying it\u2019s going to run up through the presentation, or what[removed]I\u2019m literally always worried. About everything.I dunno I made a bunch bought it at 15, sold around 28. Got FOMO, re bought at 25 and here I sit. I have a feeling the selloff after lockup expiry isn't going to be that earthshaking and that will inspire another leg up. I could be wrong.My thumb is soreThanks, I\u2019ll check it out! PLTR has brought me so much!There's a lot of dumb rocket emojis around and posts with no info in them, but pltr isn't over, it hasn't even started.\n\nPeople in here trying to get rich quick lose interest when something doesn't gain 100% in a day but that doesn't mean shit.Only 25k?!

If your own DD does not support your play, you shouldn\u2019t put any money in it.Yes it definitely fucking matters if you came from Stanford, go to a job interview once in your life and you'll know what I'm talking about.Dont ever sell options. Play with shares preferably. avoid buying short dated options. New traders over trade, have some patience. Do your own research and form an investment theory before buying anything, and dont rely on the DD on WSBs.

If you paid a $3 premium then you need BB to reach $13 to at least break even. The cost of the contract is premium price x 100 so for my example that single contract would cost $300. Do some more research before you get into options because you can lose money fast and easy.[deleted]Yesget ready for 600Me after buying 80 shares of tlry at 8.60 and not knowing what a P/E ratio wasWas was confused if ER ACTUALLY stood for Earning Report or if there was some more WSB slang I needed to learn!  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Thanks Destro!  Was was confused if ER ACTUALLY stood for Earning Report or if there was some more WSB slang I needed to learn!  I\u2019ll hop over to options and check it out!!  Thank you for the directions!We want a squeeze...right?Yeah but TSX is open....Do American brokers close for business? Because like the other person said; BB is Canadian and trades on TSX which is open Monday.Frustration. I was 30% up and lost all. I learned now. Next time first I will take profit and then reinvest.There hasn\u2019t been a catalyst. They sold some patents, \u2018settled a lawsuit\u2019 with Facebook, and had some random presentation yesterday. I have no clue what it was about but it clearly didn\u2019t blow any minds because day ended red. \n\nLet\u2019s hope as this was an accidental buy. Placed the order Thursday night thinking I could get one in on everyone. Bit me in the ass. \n\nBetween this and my 2/19 $20c on the MJ ETF, I am all in.I will need to dig thru their SEC filings. Will update when I get any new InformationWith ya on that one! Lots of time \ud83d\ude80I'm just a professional idiot with only half an idea how options work. I'm slowly learning. I lucked into this call when I trusted a random stranger. Thank God I have 2 months to sort out what to do with it.\n\nBut I feel like the next time it says +$300, I should sell it.If you own the call contract, it\u2019s your option to exercise, not someone else\u2019s.thanks i appreciate the info..so why is it that when buying calls the lower the strike price like below the share price the more expensive the premium is?Physical Education rate, duh.A short squeeze is when those who sold without owning the shares (shorts) are forced into buying shares because they don't believe it'll go down anymore or because they run out of margin *and* there is more demand than supply. \n\nIt means shareholders can basically dictate the price they are willing to sell to the shorts, because the shorts *have* to cover their losses.\n\nThat's my understanding anyway, but I'm retarded.As long as you aren't shorting or buying puts a squeeze is good and means \ud83d\ude80 value.Monday it is! Thanks for reminding meYou should have stayed in still 10% growth in 2 days when the market opens Tuesday it\u2019ll start moving back upYou didn't lose it. You just didn't make as much as you want yet. Only way to lose is to sell.Eh they were going green all week and ended green albeit minorly on a red day before a long weekend. I think next week it will correctAlright found it (somehow first thought that it\u2019d be announced coming May):\n$90 Million cash award if stock reaches $30 before November 2023\nSource: https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/governance/notice-information-circular-fiscal-2019.pdf see page 29\n\nThe 2020 proxy states that he\u2019s earned ~$130M from 2017-2019; hence it\u2019d be a nice boost for his retirement although he probably doesn\u2019t need it.talking about after i sellThat is because if the strike price is much lower than the current price of the stock, you have better chances of profiting or at least breaking even. Those contracts are called \u201cin the money\u201d. If the strike price is higher than the current price it\u2019s called \u201cout of the money\u201d. When it\u2019s out of the money you need to hope and count on the stock going up a ton more and therefore it\u2019s more risky so it\u2019s cheaper. There are a ton of things to consider which I can\u2019t go into depth here but I recommend checking YouTube for more explanation. Good luck!It\u2019s not pltr earnings????Im too inexperienced to fuck with calls and puts. Im only buying shares currentlyHow can you be so sure?so lets say i buy a $12 Call for 6/18 for $BB for 10 contracts with premium of 2.41 totaling a Max Cost of $2410, at worse case scenario if i dont reach past the break even number 14.41 by the expiration date, the worse that can happen is i lose all of the $2410 right? i cant lose any more than that to a point where they'll take more money out from my bank or from my buying power? sorry for the retard questions i feel at home\ud83e\udd23thankss again \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffcNo worries friend, the most you can lose is the premium that you paid for the contracts. Google options profit calculator and you can see what you stand to gain/lose at different dates in the future and at different share prices. It is quite useful.You have lot of patience....good man...Using a googled calculator, my \"entry cost\" = \"premium-or-price per option\" x 100?  That is the cost to \"get in\" and if I choose not to exercise by the expiration date, I only lose that amount, correct?\n\nIf one has strong conviction a stock will go up 100% in 2 months and the cost to get in is only $170, it seems like a no brainer (I know, nothing is guaranteed)to use BB as an example (i'm completely inventing these numbers):\n\nsay BB is at $10, and you buy a call option for $3.50 with a march expiration date. you will pay $350 (3.50x100) for that. That gives you the right, but not obligation, to buy 100 shares of BB for $10/each on or before March of this year.\n\nIf the share price is below $10 it's utterly worthless, and if it's below $13.50 it's not worthless but still you lost money on the deal overall. When buying this call, the max you can lose is the $350 you paid for it.\n\nIf BB is at $20 in march, the call will theoretically be worth $10 (the difference between 10 and 20 is 10, x100=$1000). Thus you've turned your initial $350 into $1000. Pretty cool. But, if it's worth $9, you get nothing. If it's worth $12, it's worth $2 (aka $200), which means you didn't completely go bust but still lost $150 on the deal.\n\nIn this last case (it's $12 in March) spending $1000 on shares would have netted you a 20% return, whereas by buying a call you lost $150. As with everything in the financial world, there's a risk/reward at play - options are greater risk with greater reward.\n\nAlso be very cautious anytime you feel yourself having \"strong conviction\\[s\\] that a stock will go up 100% in 2 months\", as those generally tend not to play out. I hope it does, and if it did, owning a call option would be a great play. But if you're not experienced in trading options, please go easy until you understand your risk tolerance and how much you can afford to lose, because sometimes you'll hit big and all is right with the world, other times you lose it all and spiral into a void of self-loathing.

It's been unreceptive to other good news. I can see high 7s or low 8s. Low 9 is still a good time to buy because it will definitely go up again next time they announce a partnership. The actual products wont come to fruition until later this year imo and it's a good long term buy if you get in low enough. Anything over 9 is paying too much right now.\u201cBB iS a bOoMEr pRoDUcT\u201d  get off Reddit and do your research homie. Theyre about to be heavily invested in the EV market and looking to integrate their technology by partnering with Amazon. They want to monopolize their technology inside the automotive industry.It's not the same product my guy. They no longer sell phones.You have no idea what a short squeeze is if you think 100% is a lot. Like absolutely no idea.You clearly don\u2019t know what squeeze meansAnd you may be right. I kept looking at the chart from the past month or so and it seems to be consolidating nicely creating a new low and then pushing the wall for a low vertical progression. I\u2019m hoping it lands around $9.00 but may drop below. I have my hands in at $9.65 and excited to hold and see what\u2019s happens with new news.They are already in the top 19 out of 25 EV makers and make up for 61% of the EV markets software. They have already began the monopolization and are succeeding more and more, and now they even got the Sony deal. More and more to come I think.They no longer cell phonesI first got in at 8.40 dec 1st and cost averaged down. If you can, do the same and keep buying it up when it drops lower. It really is a good stock in the long run. Dont paper hands and you'll get your profit eventually. It will probably even rocket later this year. Just wait till you can make a few bucks per share and dont get greedy. Maybe set a trailing stop loss after it goes to 10. You'll be okay but it might take a month or 2. They keep announcing partnerships so just hold strong and you wont lose.\n\nEdit:eh you're still in the green so you're not even in a bad place.

Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn\u2019t a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that\u2019s up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:\n\n[https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)\n\nEssentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem. \n\nNeedless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th \ud83d\ude0c)\n\n[https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)\n\nThen in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn\u2019t even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.\n\n**The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE\u2019s COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.\n\nNews on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.\n\nRegardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.\n\nSRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.\n\nIf you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.\n\n*\"I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family,\" Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/sorrento-therapeutics-opened-up-117-after-ceo-slam/)\n\n(Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)\n\nEven after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)\n\nI'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+\n\nAs always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.\n\n**Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.\n\n**TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = \ud83d\ude80. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.\n\nObligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 for good luck", "score": 47, "comment": "thanks for this, actually sounds promising. \ud83d\ude80Some random analyst gave it a price target of $30 around noon today so I picked up 40,  $15 calls lmao.I think at any news or even fomo we could reach $30 by eomWill take a look at this.

I'm always sketched out by biotech plays because they're dependent on their products getting approval. Approval up, no approval down. \n\nI'll take a position on Tuesday though, thanks!This is the wayBeen in this since march, started at 5$ but have since avg'd up and down to land at about 7$ for 820 shares.I hate SRNE but only because their job application looked like a 7 year old made ithaving followed this company for years, I could tell you that this company is a complete piece of shit.... The management is quite incompetent. Not sure how you did your DD and jump to the conclusion that this is a great businessLmao, this is the way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Awesome! I felt bad posting DD about a stock after a big move had already happened, but I figured a lot of people on here saw the move and I thought it would be good to illustrate that it still has some juice in it for the future.\n\nGood luck to you as well!Yeah that's my bad, there's not a big biotech presence on WSB so I wanted to post about SRNE earlier but I kept putting it off because I figured it would be stuck between $7-8 for a little while longer. I was actually waiting for it to come back down to accumulate a few more shares closer to my avg. Then this move today caught me off guard since no news has been released to justify it. But like I said, if any of their products get approved, this 20% move would only be the beginning. \n\nDefinitely do your own research on this one. Like you said, I expect it to be pretty volatile in the near-term until news is released, whether good or bad. In my personal opinion I don't see it going below 7 without news, but again, that's just a feeling from watching this stock since Dec. 2019.\n\nGood luck to you, I hope this moons for both of our sake!!That\u2019s cause mods banned be when I posted pre-pump. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx8k94/speculation_playsrne/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfCould you elaborate on what\u2019s wrong with management? Not arguing, just want to make sure everyone has a full picture of this company after reading this post.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree that the company didn\u2019t do much of anything of value during its first decade or so as a public company, as the chart shows. Even right now, they generated only $28M in revenue through Q3 of 2020 which isn\u2019t great. But my DD was more about giving people an overview of some potential opportunities  in the near future. This sub loves GME and BB, companies with historically poor management, and this is a play that offers similar upside for speculators in the next few months IMOI intend to buy $500 worth of FD\u2019s in this until March... assuming positive news breaks, ROI should be \ud83d\ude80Ah gotcha, sorry bout that.That\u2019s wild, did they give a reason?

They are contracts for the right to sell shares at a certain price. So I sold someone else the right to sell me 2500 shares at $20 by january of next year. If GME stays above that, those contracts expire worthless.When you sell puts, cash collateral gets withheld from you. A $20 strike would be $2000 in collateral. If they expire worthless, you keep all the premium cost. If they get exercised, you lose all the collateral and get 100 shares. If this happens, you still keep the premium which means that you technically bought the shares at a lower cost basis than $20.I would hire them in a second. Took a company left for dead and look where we are now\n\n\ud83d\ude0e \ud83c\udf7aI\u2019m like to say they were trying a spite move to drop a ton of shares and screw the price like it was them being fired that led to a crash.  Backfired in true justiceSame here, I'm in with a lot of shares, will probably take out some, if this squeeze really moons to 200+, but GME will definetly stay as my largest position afterwards so Ryan can work his magicWhat do you foresee Cohen doing to save the company?Same I like GameStopI wonder if Ryan didn\u2019t tweet this week just so he wouldn\u2019t pump up share price even more for these 3 boomer losers.\n\nAnd for anyone reading this that still isn\u2019t following Ryan Cohen on Twitter do yourself a favor and follow him now with notifications turned on.

Autist here! Reporting for duty; at 0500 I will be draining all my savings to go head first in BB. We may lose some battles, but we will win the war. Let\u2019s get some fucking tendiiiieeeessss!!!This is beautiful \ud83d\ude2dNokia NOK is the next BBWhat about Kim Kardashian? I think she got some cum on her back...I kept reading John Cenawhy hasn't anyone just taken the moneyball technique and applied it to money?Kardashian love a good cumback story.There\u2019s some quality irony to the BB symbol and the fact that, per the movie, Hatterberg always gets on base. You think maybe he works a walk. And that\u2019s okay. But then he crushes it into the stands and takes all the bases. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80#It\u2019s hard not to be romantic about tendiesFunny thing is, BlackBerry is actually a good investment on top of being a FOMO stock right now. Price to Book is only 2.2x, Price to Sales is 4.2x, revenue loss bottomed out back in 2018 and since has been gaining, posting $1B last year. They\u2019re gaining marketshare in their cybersecurity division, data analytics look strong, ton of patents (1000s), partnerships with Amazon and they\u2019re one of the leading tech companies leading the charge to integrate technology into autonomous vehicles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck... I should have bought more.Dude this is me. By the hype, sell the news.Full send it next weekIt did pretty good compared to overall downfallCould be wrong, but I think it bottomed out at 10.25yes. it's the beginning of a long weekend. sell offs. b patient bb. especially when you take into account the heavy volume during after market and open. $10+ is the new bottom.I had 10 contracts for 10 c 1/8 RIP so closeThat was definitely improv haha, what a total legend.

Search youtube about what it is and how it works.\n\n[https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/](https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/)I'm glad I \"FOMO\" into BB, bought shares for the long run, waiting for the comeback. \ud83d\ude80Price came down and still going south...You have no idea what stands behind words you have just used.I\u2019m already tapped for this play.

I want to believe this as strongly as Tom Cruise believes in Scientology. I don\u2019t think $10 unrealistic. Hell I don\u2019t think $12-13 by EOY is far fetched either. But I got a couple of 9c on 1/29 that need to at least break even at $10.Drop $4000? Did you lose money on $BB?same I should have just sold but I am learning the value of diamond hands in this sub. It works.I was just joking, the techniques for moneyball come from money (hence the name), it would be redundantWhatsApp being dirty with terms and conditions, we'll all be back on blackberry messenger soon enough. Heard it here first.I work in investment management, I have my 7, 66 and my CIMA designation. Don\u2019t let the fact I post memes make you think otherwise. Valuation wise BlackBerry is way more attractive than similar companies. \n\nSo go fuck yourselfYeah I missed out on GME and went balls deep into BB.What did you guys buy calls a week out? Do longer term calls in the future, less risk and you still can get a nice payday on big moves, not as much obviously, but still. Hell, I\u2019m not even in calls, I\u2019m just long the stock, but that\u2019s also cause it\u2019s an investment for me, not a trade.I was up $4500 on BB 1/29 calls and now I\u2019m only up $1000ImpossibleSomeone doesn't follow daddy Elon. Use signalI'm 20 deep on game and grabbed 22 BB today. Starting slow but I'm having a ton of fun. The GME rise really was great to see, my coworker who is late 50s told me I was an idiot for buying GME. Not so dumb now huhHopefully it flys to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I mean I bought stock at $9.13 so I'm still up right now.

This is still reddit, I'm gonna jump at the opportunity to tell someone they're wrong.Same...Same exact boat... :/Same, I\u2019m in at $7.52 and holding. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near done. The market cap is still small enough for us to have an effect.We can do it!  I didn't sell BB $9c 1/22 this morning when it was up 3,200% from when I bought it, because I BELIEVE IN NEXT WEEKI bought in at $8.11 and holding. I think this has some runway.

Hold tight see you on the moonGuys we need to push them more \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I bought shares, can\u2019t buy options where I trade..Can\u2019t buy or sell options, just sharesbro, it JUST started you\u2019re not too late!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80see you on the moon>Only had one big day, except for a month or so ago. Might run for a while due to being so low.Placed an order for 7500 shares at openNo one is selling my $15c 2/5 :(I bought 250 shares at around $7 just before the Amazon IVY pump. \n\nI sold after the earnings, as outlook was very disappointing. Honestly, the business is operating at a big loss and they've been in the automotive business for years now.\n\nThe news with Sony and Huawei are promising, but keep in mind that the first IVY vehicles will be on the road in mid 2023, this is a very long play, and that is IF they actually pull off good unit economics for software revenue. So far, most of their revenue comes from IP licensing, which isn't a very strong growth point.\n\nI probably should have kept my shares in all honestly, feeling a bit salty and FOMOing too here, but it's already up 200% almost since a few weeks ago. The market is pricing these things in.\n\nBe careful, when the Berry burns you, it burns you bad and it hurts :(\n\nGodspeed though, all the best!BB long which strike? open?Well for me it's either my attention goes to calls or my job as SW engineer... But definitely stocking up on shares as wellYep, Made $3500 but this morning could have sold for $17.5k. It's a strange and lame feeling to be upset when you made $3500 in 1 day, but it happens when you see what you could have had...not my first time.Still buying at open?   Are there still tendies left in this.\n\n:Edit:Realistically won\u2019t think fall below $15 again soon before it goes back up? I imagine a lot of people are treating this as a PnD and shorting tonight rather than a long holdThanks! Been a long time lurker here so finally felt like I should join the forces! Hope you see nothing but green come your way fellow soldierIdk how to value crowdstrike I don\u2019t really understand it like some others in the internet space wouldLike my bid/option price or the price of BB will drop below 10?Yea if I load today I'll probably end up being 9ish EOD.\n\nDon't forget CEO john has bonus vesting up to $125mil if the stock hits $30. \n\nHe gets half ish at $16. \n\nEven if u load now it's free 50% gains are current pricesThis just in, ride it to 1000is there much of a difference between the two for potential jumps??right on - thanks brethren.

GME to the moon! Bb takes backseatI'm in shares.I'm working on learning to not look at what could have been, and instead be happy with having a good exit strategy and making money. If I play the woulda coulda game, eventually I know I will get burned..Going to buy some PM and then throughout the day.It wouldn't be a PnD if it is undervalued. It's headed to tendie town. If anything the 7% of shorts will probably start to cover as they're getting new deals.Well BB is def gonna go up not down and when it goes up the premium will go up so your total contract price will go up hence it won\u2019t fill. No one gonna sell you a cheap option when the price keeps mooning \ud83d\ude80I mean it depends how much you borrow lolExactly. I'm maxed out now.I mean, if you're trying to save 60 bucks and play it perfect sure, but you could miss out on upside doing that. Or buy in chunks.thank you sir... We all need to help each other out... I am glad to do my part...Up to 45k shares. 15k of those are on margin.Then who is?Hope you're hungry.I\u2019m on this ride baby to the moooooon fellow retards47 shares in let\u2019s ride \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80is there much of a difference between the two for potential jumps??  \n\n\nI;m in NYSE fully and worried I made the wrong move.IM NYSE \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf15tsx please :)Shares...Who does this guy think he is giving us sad newsPapa Buffet said it best.\n\nIf you hear counter arguements to your thesis and you get mad, you are gambling.Buying right at open or waiting for dip?Totally.Its heading to ATH despite being a disappointing adventure of a company trying to find a way to market a product and make money. Not sure how you call it undervalued unless you zoom out to when they were the best cellphone manufacturer over a decade ago.Well aren\u2019t the sell options already on the market for sale? I\u2019m confused. The 9.5 option is at .39Don't worry i got fucked \ud83d\ude10Well since they make software for cars and phones and not data analytics or cybersecurity I'll let you decide...Always75 BB share gang checking inYeah, I always feel I'm fucking myself when I buy on NYSE.

They're a software company now.They\u2019re starting partnerships with AMZN and SNEDid your order fill? It won\u2019t fill til open. What you see now for options ends at market close and will update at market open.\n\nOptions can\u2019t be traded after hours or premarket so prices you see are as of 4pm ET yesterday. The price increase in BB after hours and premarket doesn\u2019t get reflected in the option price yet until market opens at 930no idea, I just have a lot of XIU lolBasically stonks go up and they share their wives.Same.I'm aware but what makes them cheap other than their inability to make a profit on software? By the time they open up the market at $11.50 I don't see it as cheap at all.Ahh gotcha. So that\u2019s why GME options are so much more expensive.Cheap on a x rev and compared to competitors.I guess I've just followed and been disappointed in BB for so long I just can't get excited about it again.

Rainbow bears said that when GME was $10.

Thinking of going in on this \ud83d\ude80What\u2019s the different between that and if I do $10c 3/19?Buy shares dude don't gambling for 1 dayOnly if you have the buying power to execute the contractDon\u2019t let them expire, sell them before then at profit.You make your profit based on the interest in the contract and how much time is left in it. You can still make a small profit without reaching the break even price if it starts to move up in a way that the contract becomes more valuable for it\u2019s strike price. Once you see what your max profit is like you want to sell to close before stock price and the contract price falls more. It\u2019s easy to miss ouut and for the contract to fall in price quickly but sometimes you gotta be patient too. To be honest I don\u2019t know shit about delta theta and all that other stuff but there are tools online that you can see how the contract is valued on a chart by searching the stock on the website.Depends on your broker... I know robinhood sells the contract for you if you don't have enough purchasing power.  \n\nBut it's usually it's a good idea to NOT let it expire and sell for profit a day beforeWait, let me ask your wifesame. i jumped in after a december DD, bought 1/15 9c and sold 2 days ago at -95%. I cant believe my timing.Same here for a loss. Feels bad. I still have a Jan 2022 15c I bought last month though.Profit is profit manNot just Sony. APPLE will use QNX for their car.

Or do I just lose the premium paid?ok this makes sense i think thank u for helping a tardshes at her boyfriends house on weekdays good luck reaching herAnd what is this QNX you talking about? Am retarded.$30 by EOM. It will be the next GME if we use our collective will to make it so.EOW would be literally today.Depends if boomers realize the significance of blackberry being in damn near every EV. Unfortunately boomers always disappoint so I think $100 is overly optimistic.Just put in orders to sell everything at open \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I have 12c 2/5\n\nEdit: probably going to buy more 12c 2/5 calls$10c 3/19I personally plan on holding a couple of months with the sort of news they have been dropping.  I think post-covid we are going to be seeing a real surge in EV related markets, especially with many places trying to push electric vehicles by certain years.I have no know idea. But I know exactly that it'll be \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 next couple months.No problem <3Gonna do 12 of 1/22 15c, wish I could do more lolDrops below the strike? Then it can\u2019t exerciseQNX is an Operating System designed by Blackberry that's geared towards Artificial intelligence. The main target is Autonomous vehicles (EV OR ICE doesn't matter). Every OEM is basically writing their own Autonomous driving program but none of them have a developed OS.\n\nBlackberry QNX is already in 175m cars and it will only rise with EV\n\nOnly other competition is Linux, which when it comes to safety regulations it will not passMisspelled, I meant to click M instead of W. I need to sleepfuck... well i\u2019m still hard either way \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Shit....i mainly do long term investment but I\u2019m going to ride the BB ship.Personally after this much of a gain, I wouldnt touch long options cause of IV. I have stocks and might sell some puts to open.Ok I think I understand. Will read more. Thank you \u2764Which cars already use this out of curiosity? I\u2019ve been sleeping on BB so all this is new to me.Linux isn\u2019t really one thing. That said, you\u2019re correct. The trend with shit products is to develop something running on internal Linux.\n\nThis is great and high quality IF you have high quality dev team AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERS to make sure that your underlying product is secure.\n\nWhat you end with most of the time? A product that has a hole somewhere in the underlying OS that no one is good enough to notice and patch. \n\nThe amount of IOT devices I see that are literally a shit app slapped onto a random Linux distro and slapped into thin plastic and no hardening is ridiculous. IOT Cameras with open telnet ports, IOT bondage devices that get hacked and peoples genitals literally held hostage by hackers ( google it lol ), it\u2019s crap.\n\nWhat QNX offers - from what I gather, I\u2019m far from in the loop on car tech - is an OS they can build off of that is secure instead of an app they slap together.\n\nSo it\u2019s not quite in competition with Linux, Linux isn\u2019t one monolithic thing. That said, yeah BB all the way.God damn it, all in it is!True true, I\u2019ll see what happens on market open. Also have my eyes on SENS.Def look into it. There\u2019s a lot of helpful articles or YouTube videos. For the Greeks focus on theta to start and then IV. It will help you understand WHY the contact is priced where it isXPENG uses it primarily so far I believe in their *Xpeng* P7.Yea I'm not a programmer so I only know as far as what I've researched. What I really meant to say is currently on the commercial sector there's no real competition to Blackberry QNX. I only listed Linux as a possible competitor just because I'm pretty sure tesla AP is built on it or Ubuntu.

So what would you have to do? Sell it or exercise it? (Also idk what it means to exercise it)Nah , you can actually sell a call without buying one first,  you just need to put a margin in to be allowed to do that tho , it's very risky and I don't recommend it . Selling a call outright basically means you are selling someone to buy 100 shares of X stock . You would basically be writing a contract. \n\nWhen you buy a call however you are buying someone else's contract so when you sell it you are basically selling the original contract you bought.When you go to trading options you have the option to buy or sell a call. You can technically sell a call without owning it , if you do this and the buyer of you call excersises his call option you would be held liable for 100 stocks. \n\nIf you buy a call option , let's say  1- $15c 1/29 and then sell it for a profit loss  you wouldn't be held liable since you started with buying a call .\n\nSelling a call outright without buying one first and called shorting and will hold you liable for a chance of assignment.$15C 1/22 LFG \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Godspeed! I bought 165 shares in early December.For sure appreciate it!Grats and fuck you. \nWhat calls are you thinking?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02LmfaoOK IM BUYING IM BUYING LETS GOI laughed so hard coke came out my nose.  Had to cut her hair off and sift it to put it back in there.Sorry, I'm a young buck who's new to this. I hear ya loud and clear!Any ideas then? Otherwise sharesYeah for 1/29I can still sell before 12 pm PACIFIC TIME.  But I am definitely not exercising it.Oh ok thanks for clarifying, it\u2019s taken me two straight days for my autist brain cells to synapse this infoWonder what we are gonna be eating on PlutoYoooo I didn\u2019t selll off them calls wtfThis is a total noob question I can probably just get 6 contracts and I\u2019ll probably do $12c 1/29 but would I make less money if I bought 46 shares instead of the call? Both cost the same amount reallyNo worries . We aren't wall street , we share the wealth mother fucker.  Lets get this money.A call is worth 100 shares. \n\nThe amount of people who have no idea what calls are on this sub is retarded. \n\nYou are buying the option of buying 100 shares at a set price. \n\nSo $12c 1/29 means you are buying the option to buy 100 shares at $12 on the 1/29. \n\nIf the price goes to $13 then you have a contract worth ~ $100. If the price hits $15 then you have a contract worth $300. \n\nIf you buy 6 calls at $12 and the shares hit $15 then you will have contracts worth $3600. \n\nIf you buy 46 shares at $10 and they reach $15 you will have made $230.Dude honestly I\u2019m pretty noobie when it comes to this too, but if u want long term growth, I think u gotta go with the shares.This is gonna be my first options trade im scaredAll in 15c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80More risk in calls but more reward. If you don't hit your strike price by expiration your investment goes to 0. You could always sell out prior to expiration though. Each option contract gives you control of 100 shares so it's really levering up that initial investment.For options, dip your feet slowly.  Dont spend your while wad prematurely.  Also start with longer expiries as opposed to really short dated ones until you get a better feel for IV, hype, and greeksAlso what do you think about $12c 1/29? Are you gonna put in positions tomorrow at open?Thank you for explaining it to me!!!I'm in the Sept $10 calls. I got it today when the stock was at $9. Hopefully see a good return on this already tomorrow but I'm holding it through. I think this stock has room to run. I think it will hit $12 by 1/29 but you have to see what the premium you're paying on the option is. For example, if you're buying the $12 and paying $2 per contract that means  the stock needs to hit $14 for you to break even. From what I saw earlier today, the premiums on the further out options were cheap for the upside. I got my calls for 2.80. If I was going in for more I'd look at the $15c further out but $12 1/29 may not be bad depending on that premium.  Stocks up big after hours so everything is going to jump tomorrow morning.that's gonna be pretty risky with only about 2 weeks to expiryI\u2019d literally pay you to mentor me.. thank you so much for helping me understand. So if I did $10c  1/29, and since that\u2019s the deeper ITM, the less the stock has to rise in order to break even. Would that be a better/safer call?No, if it's deeper in the money you will have to pay for that. It is embedded in the price of the call. There are several inputs to the price of the call including the share price, the strike price, how volatile people think the stock will be (higher during events like earnings releases), and time until expiration (theta). If you buy a $10c and the stock is $11, there is already $1 of intrinsic value that you have to pay for in addition to paying for the other components. If it's at $11 and you buy an $11c then there is no intrinsic value and you're paying for only the other components. As you move the strike higher from the share price the lower the option will cost just due to the lower probability of reaching it. If you pull up yahoo finance you can look at the options and see how the price changes based on different strokes, expiration dates, etc.  There are also implied volatility calculators out there that can show you what is priced in. When some of these stocks get moving you can see implied volatility of 100%+ which means you're paying a steep premium.", "linkFlairText": "Meme", "totalAwardsReceived": 4, "rating": 6.086112241459354}, {"id": "kxl0ll", "stockTicker": "BB", "title": "$BB TO PLUTO \ud83d\udc8eCONNECT THE DOTS\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selfText": "", "score": 240, "comment": "Is it too late to buy when the market opens?

I don\u2019t understand how it really works this will be my first options buy. Also I\u2019m talking about for tomorrow, which one would be better?So how\u2019s this work exactly?\n\nYou\u2019re betting that by February 19th the stock will reach $14. And if you\u2019re right you have the right but not the obligation to sell your shares or something?What position?Both are goodProfit on a call is unlimited, profit on a put is limited by the fact the stock can't go lower than zero. There is some after hours things you can do but its limited.are you meomg I found my people.No one knows how to do anything here, retardOnly some brokers allow it and only after you make a special request.  \n\nBut don't worry,  you can buy shares now and strap on for the ride.Beware of the options!I bought an option once. Cost me $140.\nThats the whole story.I had 4 options for $12.5 and I sold them all at close today. Made a ton of money but I could\u2019ve made moreSo $75?What is BB? Doesn\u2019t matter. Those are my initials. It\u2019s a sign.This killed me when I was trying to buy more GME, had money waiting to go in but due to the holidays(banks closed) it took a while.

Plus Canada. Plus recognized name.\"making stuff\"I know it\u2019s a month old, but it gives a little more context other than because r/wallstreetbets posting rockets.\nBut just in case: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I\u2019m going to watch it for a little bit, might buy more calls if it looks like a longer term trend, I think it will though, next GME! \ud83d\ude80Yeah my calls are dropping, I\u2019m hoping tomorrow it will bounce up again.I wondering if I should sell my 9$ callsI NEED TO KNOWSooo, 20-never?I think I'll stick with shares for now until I do some more research!Would you recommend I buy $7c 3/19 tomorrow or $12 1/29I\u2019m dumb and trying to be less dumb. Why buy at $7? Isn\u2019t it at 10? I\u2019m missing this crucial part!\n\nYou answered this in a later post never mind. Thank you!New here. Why a $7 call when it's at 9~ currently unless you expect it to go down? Eli5?\n\nI made a 15c for 1/22 because I have no money and I had the funds in my accountI would honestly buy straddles if you gonna play. BB has been giving up gains every pop. I\u2019m super long term on blackberry 370 shares and 3 7C\u2019s 2023(I have a small account). Premiums are gonna be al types of fucked. Wait for the eventually dip and get in long. Let IV chillWhat date did you set it for?It\u2019s not better or worse, it was just a cheap premium and I\u2019m optimistic for the stock to take off. 1/29 $12c is perfectly fine if you\u2019re looking for a shorter term play, seems fine to me if the premium allows you to buy the volume you wantit's a call, not a put.\n\nyou're buying a contract to purchase 100 shares of $BB for $14/share on or before 2/19. So if it goes over $14, you make money. Let's say it's $15, you exercise the option and buy those 100 shares for $14, so you're automatically up $100.\n\nWhat happens more often though is that people buy and sell just the contracts without necessarily exercising them. So like I buy a contract for 1/15 9c and I pay $0.27/share ($27 total price for the contract), then the stock goes up and suddenly the ability to buy shares at $9/ea becomes more desirable so the price goes up and now that same contract is worth $0.54/share, or $54. \n\nso to somebody who has the capital to exercise it, they see that the stock price is currently $9.60/share, which would be $960/100 shares, or they can buy my contract for $54 and buy 100 shares for $9 per the contract = total price for them comes to $954.Nah, 14 is the strike price, depending on his premium it might have to reach 15+ to break even. He won't buy the shares., instead he'll just sell the option so some other retard will buy it.All of them.Thanks for the info!We are all the same.That was all my parents would let me borrow. \ud83d\ude02BB is \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yea that\u2019s not bad at all, such a bad time to make a deposit on my part before a weekend lolAll in on 1/15 20c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ive been in since 2018....get me back to green boys. 300 at $13.01 and still have room to avg down lolBut what happens if it goes wrong?\u201cTits up\u201d is sooooo fucking funny.

If you bought 1 contract and it failed to hit strike price, do you now owe the cost of 100 shares of the stock, or have you just lost the max price?Bro, 3k savings from last few months all in. I don't got knee surgery but hey \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 rightAlso has to be small enough, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, we\u2019re not influencing Amazon, but we can influence small and mid cap stocks... and Tesla for some reason..Yeah, of course it'll give it plenty of time to get wayyy above the breakeven.\n\nRemindMe! March 19, 2021Strike price. I paid an avg of $0.90 for each so I've already made money.Context<\ud83d\ude80It also went up on that news and then went down right after even after good earnings.\n\nI'd love to know the real reason it spiked besides everyone happened to remember the whole amazon thing.Nah bro that shit is gonna print.you got itYou still might profit, but generally buying OTM calls with a short expiry is very stupid. Its always safe to just buy slightly ITM calls for a bit longer period out7c is too far ITM for how far it moved after hours. Something like a 2/19 9c wouldnt be bad. But dont wait much longer after market open because its going to moon.Because the deeper ITM you are, the less the stock has to rise in order to break even. Since you are so far out OTM on short expiry, you\u2019re more likely to lose your money. But this is a meme stock so it has crazy growth, who knows.So essentially they\u2019d either spend $960 for 100 shares of a stock at $9.60 OR they spend $954 for 100 shares at $9 right?\n\nThe latter being the obvious choice because they not only pay less but they\u2019re getting the stock at a discount. \n\nAm I understanding right?This is the type of comment I\u2019ve been looking for, THANK YOU!Now is the time to learn. I rarely do options (FD\u2019s) and I\u2019m all-in here. Now you can be like the GME autists.My moms boyfriend said not to gamble the money.

GME seemed weird, but it made a lot of sense if you informed yourself properly. BB is just some wanna-be stock imo. Could be entirely wrong thoughIt fucked me today and I\u2019m not proud of it. Red is bad, apparently.When you sell a $16 covered call back in November... That's how you get Fed on PLUG.He\u2019s probably riding the short busMan I\u2019d go yolo it and then it would tank. I should\u2019ve gotten in a couple days ago for the fresh tendies. Imma stick with BB.I\u2019m the original autist.Thank you, you guys are awesome.

Lesson learnt.are you fucking stupid WSB absolutely caused the squeeze. We owned like 20% of the shares.Is the GME train done for?I'll bet my kids future on the memeability of this one.BB is also easy to spell which is a real plus.Been awhile since I hopped on a meme so goddammit I'm in.  AH stonks and callz tomorrow.Soon9/17 $9C and I\u2019m in the money after only 7 days with 8 months before expiry and no idea what to do with calls that far away6/18/21 $15 call. Up 265% today. 40 contracts, finally in the green today. Up about $1600Bought the 10 and 12.5 back in Aug... up 600%+ and 400%+ since. \n\nBe wary, it pulls back over time but the news is buzzzzzzzzzinYou are stupid, but probably more confused than stupid.\n\nLEAPs work just like any other option, they're just a year+ out.\n\nThe nice thing about them is they derive a large part of their value from time, so they stay worth a lot of money even if price goes against you.\n\nthey have a strike price just like any other option and if the strike price is below current price, you are ITM on a call and OTM on a put. Just like any other option.Calls or sharesOnly conference I found on BB's press release site is at 1:15 pm EST: \n\n[Needham\u2019s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference](https://wsw.com/webcast/needham103/bb/1838040)  \nFriday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15pm ET  \nRyan Permeh, BlackBerry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, BlackBerry Chief Product Architect in virtual conversation with Richard Valera, Needham & CoI think it\u2019s at 1:15pm ET.

Entered in when options were trading ~0.10LeverageFor the most part people do not exercise their options, even if they are far in the money. They usually get sold before expiration, or expire worthless if you made a bad bet.You can resell the option contract and keep all the profit from the stock value increase. (without buying stock)100 shares is $900. But 10 contracts at .90 each is 1000 shares for $900. So much more profit/loss potential for the same price for those who are lower on capitalYou can make way more buying options than shares. If you buy 100 shares at $9 and he sells at $18 he's only making $900 in profit. And that's assuming the price doubles. \n\nMeanwhile he could buy options for February or March for a $10 or $15 strike and make significantly more than $900. If you're crazy confident a stock will hit a certain price and aren't afraid of some risk options can make sense5x $15 calls, exp feb 5th.\n\n1x $15 call, exp march 19th.\n\nThese are pretty far OTM (outside the money) though, so if you aren't a YOLO FOMO WSB artist you might want to buy something closer to the current price and or longer dated.\n\nBut I think we rocket into tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Same pretty pls I'm newJust ask your wife's boyfriend to explain it, that's what I do.Thanks for asking this question I've had no idea for ages what this shit was.Google options platforms ukIdk for sure but check if Degiro available in uk. Also tradestation and interactive brokers, but aprooval takes a few days.Interactive brokers or tastyworksYou won't be able to trade options in the UK, however you can trade CFDs or spread bets which both allow you to leverage you money. Just be aware of your margin and ensure you have sufficent funds for your position.Ya I was trying at 8.53 , the ln 8.65, 8.75 finally just set limit of 8.90 and filled at 8.90Not enough rockets. Not fully convinced yet.You got the right ideawhy are they misalignedJudging by the rockets I think BB should worth $300 a share by the end of 2021You clearly have no idea what you\u2019re talking aboutWhat makes you think I'm kidding. In fact, I've rationalized 1000 shares now. Idgaf if it gaps up I'm in baby.This is WSB, Wendys doesn't pay that much.  He meant, literally $30.

See you on the bright side of the Moon! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80What call should I make for tomorrow? Do I buy one set to expire tomorrow?I think you're lost, r/investing is -> that way.Appreciate your advice, I think I'm mostly in that position now, I have about 20k available to get started, I've put 4k into SPY for long term and I've been using 1k to learn the ropes which is what I've split up between these shares and some others, not going to commit any of the rest until I learn more and get some hands on time.I bought 1 call cause why not. Dumped the rest in shares. Retards to the endI literally opened my trading account like 3 days ago and all this is new to me. I was told options are complicated so it kinda scared me away. I bought a 2/5 $11 call @$1.06 just to see what happens tomorrow. Hope this works out.how is that percentage calculated? What did you pay for the call and what's the target? \ncan you explain to me: options are shares make the same amount of money or not? \n\nlet's say the stock is $10, and you have $20 call. \n\n* you buy 100 shares for $10 (-$1k) and sell for $20 (+$2k) you made $1k profit\n\n* you buy a $20 call for $X (idk how much, but i assume not much, say -$100). Then you exercise the call to get 100 shares, you pay -$900 ( $10*100 - what you already paid, correct?) and sell for +$2k). It's the same $1k profit right? \n\nSo the percentage you listed is the difference between call cost ($100) and net profit ($1000)?? So in this example it's 900%?At what strike and premium?Exactly what I told myself \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80for once im glad I didn't inverse OP. good call my guy9.50 1/22 checking inMe too.

Had to make two 911 emergency phone calls in life or death situations then. Both times someone died. In one of those situations the victim could have been saved if they could have gotten there seconds sooner. But.. Both times the emergency call dropped. Fucking dropped! Just like their \ud83d\ude80. Through the investigations they found that the call dropping was 100% the devices fault. I found out then that they were notorious for dropped calls and very quickly bought a differant brand phone. When I told one of my engineer friends over at Black Berry this, he confirmed to me it was a known issue. He is now one of the department heads.. Love the guy.. But yah..

That shit is dynamite baby.I have the option to buy 6600 shares for the premium of 10k because I have 66 contracts. Most people don't actually take the shares, they just sell the contract at a higher priceFor selling a call option, are you only exchanging the premium? Do the stocks themselves ever change hands?

Expected console sales were already priced in. It's not like the console release was a surprise that came out of nowhere. It's pretty well known gme didn't get many given to their stores too. That exact number won't even be released till April. \n\nThe short squeeze hasn't even happened yet either. \n\nThe only big catalyst is Cohen and the two other chief executives joining leadership to rebuild gme's business model.Covid will probably last another year at least.Im pretty sure from a reliable source that the bankruptcy will be inevitable this year.How?  Sell the original and buy more?  Why would that be more beneficial than hanging on to the original that was purchased at a lower premium?I\u2019m a bit worried this is going to be a palantir redux where it rises fast, but the. it\u2019s stagnant for a long time, and a better use of capital would be to sell one or two contracts to invest somewhere else that\u2019s on the verge of busting through.You should buy shares. \n\nA call is where you\u2019re buying the rights to 100 shares and basically you\u2019re gambling on the possibility it will go up to a certain amount by a certain date. Rocket potential upside and catastrophic potential downside (if it doesn\u2019t reach what you predicted it would, you lose 100% of it, and it goes down quickly if you guess wrong). Also, once the rocket has initiated liftoff, you e pretty much missed the possibility of making a profit on calls. \n\nTLDR: buy shares until you\u2019re ready to go full R.Calls are bets that the stock will go up in the future and give you a right to buy 100 at a certain price (or you can sell the contract)Only one rocket emoji is terrible. Time to buy puts!DD?Sadly you can\u2019t trade options on Etoro (neither Revolut, which - as a Europoor - I\u2019m using. Thinking about switching to Interactive Brokers).\nBefore you get into options trading, definitely watch videos / read about it first. It\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 casino: it can give way higher returns than just owning a share, also zou can easily lose all your money (see posts flaired as \u201cLoss\u201d, aka lossporn).\n\nAlso welcome to WSB, happy trading and fuck you in advance for your gainz to come ;).Hmmm strange I just checked and its there for me. Next to \"discover\"If you go back to the trade options page, to the left of the dates you should see a tab that says \"Discover\"\n\n\nI recommend clicking that and reading through the Robinhood info they provide on that page and then watching a few Youtube videos.\n\n\nI've read countless reddit posts/comments about options trading but what really helped me was seeing others do it via a video and then making some low risk ones myself.Hell ya!! Quick question you may know. I bought calls after market for .83 cents. Will they now not go through bc the post market? I\u2019m an idiot!!!No shit, retard.The guy who sold it to you is hoping that it expires worthless, so no stock ever has to change hands. And the vast majority of people buying calls are not doing so with the hopes of obtaining 100 shares of a stock, but rather to have that contract itself rise in value so they can sell the contract for a profit. But once it's been created, that option basically goes into a pool of options at the same strike and expiration, so sellers aren't under contract with a particular person, but more just the market itself.\n\nAt least that's how I think about it in my limited understanding, I'm far from an expert, having just started this hobby of messing with options after Fantasy Football season ended. I'd recommend checking out some basic options tutorial type videos on youtube if you've got a little time, the basics can be grasped fairly easily IMO.Check out https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/\n\nIf you really want to learn and you use Robinhood, this video is as good as it gets:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms\n\nYou should really be thinking of options as just that, options. You are paying a **premium** to buy a **contract** which gives you the option to **buy 100 shares** at the desired **strike price** anytime from now until the **expiration date**. You can **exercise** this option at anytime, or you can sell the contract back for a profit/loss.\n\nBut yes, it's essentially a \"bet.\" I think that video explains all you need to know.

This might sound argumentative but I\u2019m genuinely curiousThe console cycle isn't really priced in. Look at the last 2 cycles in historical data.

Why you're wasting everyone's time making us read this nonsense?The disease will, people are tired of the Pandemic.ain\u2019t no way GME will go bankrupt before covid is goneFuck off MelvinGME bankruptcy? So OTM PUTS?My sources have told me GameStop inc. is done and not just on twitch.The farther OTM an option is, the more money it makes moving closer to ITM.\n\nThe closer the expiry, the more money it makes as it moves closer to ITM.\n\nTake profits from a conservative leap that printed early and roll them into a closer expiry or a farther OTM or both. \n\nIts definitely an increase in risk in exchange for a larger profit %.\n\nEdit: If IV has changed drastically, maybe hold onto the original?

(Im only few days old here lol)100 fooldo you have to buy all 100?BBI'm not the one to ask, I have no idea how options work. I just buy them. No you\u2019ll need to readjust at open for a higher price. Since it mooned after close today the options prices you see currently won\u2019t fill.Trying some covered calls with BB let\u2019s see how that goes.If the stock rises to make the option valuable, why would someone *ever* sell it? Wouldn't they get a significantly better margin just executing and instantly selling the shares? Maybe they think the stock won't rise enough and try to sell it to someone who thinks it will. But that's it, really.\n\nIf you aren't buying the option to hold the shares, I guess the only reason to sell it is the edge case that you fail to believe in it anymore and want to reap back some of the premium you paid. Maybe?Just ordered a 12 dollar call expiring jan 29th. It still needs time to execute. Good call or nah?Nice video. I'm not a retard like you guys but extra knowledge never hurt. And who knows, maybe in a year or two I'll have some side cash I can yolo on the next GME...$0.53 this morning. I sold them at $1.50. But then I decided to go back in with 5 1/22 12CIf you can guess the market right, and you're not getting screwed by the market, yes.  Absolutely.  Hands down, 1000%.\n\nBut on average you're not right.  You're going to get it wrong.  You will lose these calls.  Look at the loss porn.  Study them.  Those are calls.  If they bought shares and just held and moved on with their lives they'd be fine.\n\nThe honest most accurate call- and this is the most boring answer- is to have time in the market and to not to try to time the market.\n\nJust buy some shares in something you think works, or you have a hunch on, and forget about them till a few years later or when the market rallies on something and you think you need to make a move.   And just keep piling on new shares, market up or down.  It adds up.The option gives him the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares for $15 each. That means that if the share price is $15.01 the option contract is worth 1 dollar, because he can buy the shares for $15.00 and sell them for 15.01 for a profit of 0.01 x 100 shares. At a share price of $16 the contract is worth 100 dollars. Basically, for every penny it\u2019s over 15, he makes a dollar.If the share price is $15 or below, the contract is worth 0 because its cheaper to buy the shares on the market than to buy them for $15 dollars each. He then is out the money he paid for the contract.\n\nAll these amounts are based on the share price at the day of expiration. If it hits the $15-mark before that it is worth more because of the time left componentThe short of it is; Most people sell the contract (particularly here) to someone else on the market just like you would sell a stock.  If the stock is worth more than the options are worth he /she makes a lot of money.  If not, the contract is worthless and he/she probably lost the contract fees and commission (typically they let the contract expire by the date listed).\n\nThe difference between the stock and the stock option is the stock has equity.  You get to keep the stock even if it falls in value and you can always sell at a later date.  The stock option becomes worthless after the expiration date, plus you pay a premium just to have it.  Stock options are risky, with huge pay offs if you can guess the market direction.\n\nThere are bigger plays to considered with options as well.  Such as exercising the stock option even if the stock option is below market value (maybe you think its going to be worth more in the near future?).   But this is something you need to consider with some legit due diligence because a lot of actual retardation gets floated around here.\n\nIf you want to throw some money in the pot, just buy a few shares.  Can't go wrong with building the equity.I recommend Ben Felix on YouTube.

GME and BBBY it is.truuuuuee, Ride or Diejust try itWe won't know for sure until the January 31st when we get the report update. The recent surge is due more to Ryan Cohen stepping in with two others in my opinion. With the amount of shorts out there I think that the actual squeeze will be more drastic. I could be wrong though.Because the short volume is up, not down, so it hasn't started.They just gained $300 million today.  They can last out a few more months.  Realistically you only have until now people support ending lockdowns than enforcing them. Thats going to be within the next 2 months.Bless your heart.  I can but you shouldn\u2019tYes, but you have to tell them you know what you\u2019re doing. Someone on this thread explained the button steps to me since I couldn\u2019t figure it out some time back. In five weeks, I lost about 25%.  That being said, calls also made me about 20% today, so they are a fickle mistress.  I can\u2019t tell you the button presses to do it because I don\u2019t remember them.https://youtu.be/1Y3FzVQi-R8\n\nI\u2019m bold enough to gamble all of my money, but with the internets memory and growing databases, I\u2019m not bold enough to put the word in writing on a website.Oops, my mistakeCertified autist here. At the moment BB calls at a strike price are 1.13 for 10c expiring 1/29. Do I lose the 113 dollar premium when I sell it or is that part of the value?You can either exercise your call and buy those shares or (as most people on here do) sell the contract for a profitBecause in order to execute that option, you have to actually have the money to purchase those stocks, which most autistics retards here, do not, so they sell the option under the total value such that someone else will buy and exercise the contract.\n\nThe reason why you would want to buy options instead of stocks is that you can buy \"the right\" to buy a LOT more stocks vs if you just bought stocks in the first place, giving you a lot more return when you sell that option.Let me just give you a quick example. I bought my first option a couple weeks ago, a 1/29 $12c of Tilray for .38 premium (per share, so $38 total). A few days later Tilray was already over $12 and the option was worth >$100. I sold it, and basically got 150% return. However, that very same option is now trading for over $6.50 premium the last time I checked. That $500+ that I missed out on is the whole point of purchasing that option in the first place.\n\nThat's a simple example but I think shows how my intention was never to own 100 shares of Tilray, despite being bullish on it. I get to collect the rise in price for 100 shares for significantly less money than if I'd purchased 100 shares of Tilray at the time I bought that option when it was trading at about $9.50. Options can give you significantly more leverage, however are much riskier than shares at the same time. If Tilray had tanked, I would have lost my $38 if it expired worthless.Adding one thing here: \n\nThe further a call is from an expiration date, the more time value it has (eg. there's more time for the stock price to rise even more), which factors into the option price too.\n\nSo if your call has shot up in value, then waiting until expiration might lose you $ if the stock price plateaus, as there will be time value decay. \n\nI'm also rtrd when it comes to this but pretty sure this is trueSo that will breakeven at $12.10, so if you're thinking it will get to $12.10 by Jan 29, it's a good call! I would sell about a week or so before expiry if you're up on your position because each day you suffer theta decay (look this up).Start small. Remember with buying calls, the most you can lose is what you put in.Thanks. I'm learning a lot today and getting a good idea how these work. Is it normally better to sell the option once value increases, or exercise then sell the stocks?Thanks a lot for the reply, I didn\u2019t know much about options and this helped me get a grasp on it. So your option of $12.50 on Feb 12 is pretty solid since it\u2019s already at 9.40-ish, right?I'm new to this as well. I was wondering what happens if you sell an option without actually buying it first? Do you then essentially owe whoever bought the contract 100 shares if they exercise the option?Buy high, sell higher you'll still do okPreach. GL in the trenches brothe circle-jerk or BB?Isn't there an update tomorrow?Interesting. Appreciate the response\ud83d\udc99I didnt have much trouble with it, just clicked the button for \"some experience\" and it allowed me to lose money on the stock market in a whole new way!Heh thats rookie numbers i opened an options account last February. Had no clue what i was doing. Down 99% in a month or two. Climbing my way back upOh ok. Thank you btw for defining shares and calls. If I get started on the market I will probably just buy shares xDCertified dumbass here but I will try to help.\n\nFor an options contract you will need to pay the premium. In this case the BB calls are $113 for ONE contract which controls 100 shares.\n\nTMR if the premium rises to 1.23 from 1.13 (113 to 123) and you sell the contract you will get $123. Either way you lose the premium money. It's a matter of making enough money to cover the premium.I thought I read somewhere that Brokers will let you execute and sell instantly? What is the process/option for that? I just opened a TD Ameritrade a little while ago. Wouldn't that be fine by them, especially if they could charge a fee/commission?What stopped you from just waiting and executing? Was selling the option worth more than the 100x(price-12)? I'd figure you'd want to wait to be sure where the peak was and execute on the downslide, as long as it's still above what you spent on the stocks.I guess the math can favor the options selling within a certain risk margin. \n\n\"The option *has* to go up by X more before executing is worth more than the premium now, but if I wait and sell the option later after the stock plateaus, the premiums I'll get will be lower.\"\n\nThis is territory where I can understand the principal a lot faster than I can just do the math in my head. I'm guessing there are calculators or sites people use for this.Very rarely would you want to exercise the option in this case.  Usually people sell.   It\u2019s a more advanced long term play to consider exercising the option if you have the capital and the consideration for the equity appreciating long term - couple of years typically.Nah, it's actually super aggressive.  I'd aim for something more conservative if I did it again.  I mean, what on earth does BLACKBERRY have in store that justifies a near 30% gain in a month.  So 9.4-10ish is a good call.\n\n But the rest of my spreads in steel are doing fine so... \ud83d\ude80You sell the contract on the market to someone else.  That other person then exercises the options.  It's no longer you're issue to deal with.  Typically its a larger firm that's exercising the option to buy the stock.  But that's between them.If tits up just turn the screen upside down to red rocket to the moonyupPuts expire tomorrow I believeYou\u2019re welcome man. Ask around. I don\u2019t know much, but you learn to learn quickly around here with all the fear of missjng out on the rocket ships.Ohhh gotchu. So I just purchased 11c 1/29. So I\u2019d need BB (currently at 10.4) to rise to 11 to be in the money. Anything above that and I I\u2019d be on the moon? \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Just learning, wanted to lock in profits and weed stocks are very volatile, thought it could be a temporary bump rather than what it now appears to be, a stepping stone on the way to the moon. Obviously I am regretful now and feel like I've learned a valuable lesson, but hindsight is always 20/20 and profit is profit.> What stopped you from just waiting and executing?\n\nThe chance that the stock price drops.Ideally sure. But that's trying to time the market, and being risky instead of locking in profits.Awesome thank you!Thank you so much. So as long as I buy the option and then sell it on the market I can make my tendies and no longer have to worry about that contract again.Kek, too bad im still underage so i'm just doing virtual trading on etoro. So i'm with you guys xd (i just started yesterday)Essentially yeah. But you gotta remember that a contract declines in value every single day. I'm looking at the contract right now, and since its a new one if it increased to like 10.7 tomorrow you will already make some money.\n\nI wish you good luck my man! Make that shit print and kick your wife's bf out of your house.Correct.  Just sell it (most likely) or exercise it before the expiration.Honestly, I think everyone should do that to start and learn before time is up.Yea way too broke to exercise that shit.

They've done alright given their situation, but the short squeeze from institutions betting poorly is what's driving it up right now.Wait till this guy hears about omnichannel, streaming, electronic downloads, etcCalling them a video game retailer is so ignorant, first of all, like Tesla, when you have a once in a generation type genius in charge you are investing as much in the person as the company and their products, and secondly Ryan Cohen is going to completely rebuild the business for the digital age, 35-40 is the new floorFrom an options standpoint your break even is around $17.

It was a lot easier before, now Wall Street has their hooks in them.I always thought PLTR was long term. Don\u2019t think it needs pumpingPLTR's market cap is too high.

It\u2019s so frustrating. That\u2019s how I felt though when I was losing a lot on GME, but kept the faith and was rewarded. With PLTR I feel 10x better about them then GME. I foresee daddy Karp memes is WSB\u2019s future.Yoo I got almost the same with 110 at 8,72I made the black guy Palantir because he\u2019s fat, Palantir has a huge market cap. There\u2019s levels to this.Good job, it\u2019s like I tell people, if you\u2019re not losing money, you\u2019re not trying.Palpatiinr had a shit day today tho but I\u2019m holdinghow long is longSame here, but with how reliable PLTR as a company is, our patience will be rewarded. They are a tank. Slow to move, but almost impossible to take down. Once companies start realizing the potential for using PLTR to make sense/use of their data sets, it\u2019s game over.Square moved slowly at first and dropped to $40 at the lowest during the March pandemic crash. They just closed at $232.Honestly think I\u2019m going to move my 93 shares of PLTR at open tomorrow into some BB for the cultureBlockbuster video is next!$BB this is the wayIf Blackberry wasnt named Blackberry with the stigma behind it, it would be a $20bil company right now. \n\n$50 is my target.10-25B market cap?

Let's imagine you are a big swinging dick hedge fund and you want to buy a ton of shares and ride this thing to the moon. But there's still a ton of shares not available for you to buy yet (feb lockup). Of course you aren't going to let it soar preemptively before you have loaded up. \n\nOnce lockup expires start accumulating your positions in the following days / weeks and hold forever.PLTR is extremely predictable and easy to play. Buy when it hits 23/24, sell at 26/27. It's 10% profit every few weeksBrother, Cathie wood just bought 500K shares, we are going to ValhallaI got my shares about 3-4 weeks ago when it reached $9 and then went to $6 \ud83d\ude05 honestly I think still has future, a guy posted a long and detailed DD about BB this week, you should check it out\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo4ed/looking_for_the_next_rocket_look_no_further_than/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareI have 9 shares of GME \ud83d\ude05 everybody here says that this is just starting, but try to get the best price you can \ud83e\udd20Positions for $BB?ON IT!Same, to go with my other 1240.Just bougth 200 PLTR shares. And I dont even know what they are doing. I just see lots of rocket emojis when someone says PLTRI\u2019ll be ready for activation anytime. Buying PLTR every chance I get.Agreed stop trying to steal our spotlight. Pltr is next but wait for us to finish firstGME made us millionaires, but PLTR will make us billionaires.Tsla has entered the chatLet the boys pump!!!!I mean, it is long term, but I\u2019d sure like a price hike!Yeah but you're talking to WSB here. Long term is EOM OTM calls instead of EOW OTM calls.People should sell long dated puts. you can get almost $9 right now for a november $25. You only tie up like $1k of buying power, absolute worst case you get shares at a $16 cost, if it just sits around and goes no where or goes up you make almost a 100% return on the buying power you tie up.Too real.yes just like $TSLA3/19 $10c checking in2 contracts of the same checking in \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80This guy Jelly ^\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udeecWell done Foreignbrohe's also got the worst moves of the threesource?For sure!!!!!

Bought at $20ish ( i know, late to the game), sold at 25ish today.  Bought Tilray at open, got a nice 20% gain today.  Will dump probably tomorrow and wait for discount on PLTR or maybe hold for twitterThey're like a security company now or something. And signed an automotive deal with a China company to build the self driving software for the car? Something like that. I remember people talking about it back in November but haven't heard anything else about BB till today.Swapped, they are in cybersec, electric cars and software. They also just sold like 70 pattents to Huawei.More buttons = more $$But don\u2019t listen to me because I\u2019m so retarded I can\u2019t even reply on the right commentI say shares if you can afford it. Options to max your leverageConsider it done, il post and dm you tomorrow!Interesting. The 90 patents they sold off was yesterday\u2019s news though, I\u2019m surprised the pop happened today.

I believe 80% of shares will be available for trade after that. Currently I think its only around 20%The day to day prices are different than the big green chart you see. It only reports one price per day when looking at a 3m view, and you don't see the fluctuations that i'm talking aboutDumb question: how are up when it hasn\u2019t hit $10?Same! So I sold some more stuff and bought a Mar $9 and a 2023 $10 callYOLOWhat is their product exactly?Secrets of the trade my friend ;)They don't want us to make money but eventually they will have no choice.Bought 155 (my entire account) sometime this morning, pleas fly againBro, did you even see that sweet 4% AH?What the fuck. What\u2019s your % gain rn bro I need stuff to jerk off toSqueeze me bbyi have apha stocks and calls and the other two... same with BB but with 10 8.5c 1/22 instead... hoping for 20 so i can ring that register.$1500 in $9c expiring on 1/22. Wish me luck boystrust meSame. Ridiculous.Already 20It\u2019ll hit 10 today, 20 next week, then the moon. I\u2019m in @7.40 ;)If BB jumps from $9 today to $20 sometime in the future, that contract for $430 will be worth a lot more (because the underlying asset of BB is more valuable). You could sell to close the contract at any time between now and expiration and take the difference, or, for a call option you could exercise the option at expiration and purchase the 100 shares of BB at whatever strike price you chose. Most people sell the contract before expiration and pocket the profit.Please stop using options till you read some stuff on how it works.And is that good for the stock price? By good I mean \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Lol dude I don't use RH. I'm literally looking at it on Bloomberg I can see intraday pricing just fine, that's still not a pattern that's repeated more than 3 (maybe 4 depending if you have some leeway around your ranges) times.

Intrinsic Value is 0 until the stock reaches the strike price.  But Time Value is more complicated, it increases as the share price climbs, and decreases (or decays) as time elapses.  So the value of a call option goes up when the stock goes up, even when it is \"out of the money,\" as long as they go up fast enough to beat the time \"decay\".because people are so certain that it will which makes them willing to pay more for that contract.  If it stayed at that price until expiration, the value would go down.I placed an option order this morning before market but it\u2019s not reflected yet? Anybody help me out?Pffft, wouldn\u2019t YOU like to know \ud83d\ude0eDarn I have the perfect meme video for PLTR I just need to get something working for an hour to make it. Will try again tonightThe minute buyden appointed Avril Haines as director of intelligence was the moment I knew I had to go all in[186% today, 28% overall](https://imgur.com/a/ElCBX7u)That\u2019s gonna land way in the money. Did you pick them up cheap?But why?I literally bought them just after open too for $1.02. Should have stayed at the doctor incase my erection lasts longer than 4 hours.In at 9.10 lets get it.Thank you for explaining this moreAnd the option holder would get $100 for every dollar above their strike price? Ex. $9 contract goes to $20 430 goes to 1530?I mean you're right, i've done it 4 times. But 10% per month is a pretty great return is it not? AMD and Netflix used to do the same way back when, as did TSLA.the time value of GME calls this afternoon was PEAK MONEY.This is probably one of the most concise and well put ways to explain this that I've seen.So the contract itself is fluctuating? As well as the stock? I so so dumbWell well well... I somehow missed that in my DD.\n\nGood lookin out!Yeah like $0.50/contract. \n\nI\u2019m rock hard rn looking at these AH numbers\n\nI also have GME calls that are about to print lolYou wanted a DD not a god damn philosophyI wanted to buy 20c for next year, option was not there.emptied my load at 8.53 lets take it all!!!Option have a value called delta. It determines how the option price changes with regard to the stock. For strikes near the current price(ATM: At The Money) , it's usually about 0.5 meaning for every dollar the stock goes up the option goes up $0.5.\n\nThe lower the strike, the higher the delta.The contract value will vary with time and stock price. It's not a direct 1:1 ratio.Sure I'm not saying that's not a great return, just that thinking it is \"extremely predictable\" when it's only held the range a month and a half is setting you up for heartbreak. I trade ranges on FX which are wayyyyy more stable, and still managed to get burned and lose a few months of profit being the wrong way (and trying to buy the dip) through March when USD rallied hard. And have missed out on some fantastic gains when a huge rally occurs after selling at my PT. Which again, is fine, as long as you know that's how you're playing the stock. You just have to be ok with missing out on the gains in a sustained one way rally...Because changing your mind and FOMO'ing in is usually one of the worst things you can do (unless it's TSLA).exactly, the contract price is fluidYeah which is why some people can make profits on super OTM options when the stock never even gets close to the strike price but is heading in that directionFuck yeah. I missed the GME rocket ship but I\u2019m strapped in for BB (relative to being the poor that I am, anyway).I bought 1000 shares too because my old man still uses a blackberry.I ended up not pulling the trigger on 3/19 $10c. It was in my price range and I just didn\u2019t do it! Regretting it today after chasing like an idiot. I am so close to doing this right\n\nGuess I\u2019ve got til March for it to come back a little.I guess that\u2019s where I\u2019m stuck. I understand that the contracts fluctuates, but how does the stock price effect it?Fair. I hope you're having a nice Thursday my guyGME this week was fun, but the real win for me was actually a 300% play on Tilray calls. I\u2019ve rolled the profits from that into some more later dated Tilray calls and *those* are printing too (and that\u2019s before the opt price reflects this AH fun)\n\nMy account is up like 26% this week. It\u2019s been a good weekLol amazing.\n\nMy only regret if not buying enoughhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\u2013Scholes_equation\n\nOption price varies based on a number of variables. \n\nYou are partially correct however\u2014***at expiry*** the option\u2019s value is equal to (share price-strike price) x $100 (if it\u2019s a call)That's where the greeks come into play, my man. The delta of an option determines how much the price of the contract fluctuates as the underlying stock value moves.As the other redditors have explained there are many factors at play which determine a contract's price. I'd simply reiterate that the stock price is one underlying value which directly affects your option contact's value. \n\nFor example:\nIf I sell you an option to buy a bar of gold today for $1,000 and the price of a gold bar is also $1,000, then your option is not worth anything (because you can buy the gold bar in the market for the same price I'm giving you the option for). However, if tomorrow, the price of a bar of gold is $1,200, all of a sudden the option I sold you to buy the bar of gold for $1,000 has a higher worth. Most people would sell the option to buy the gold and pocket the profit before the option expires (in case the price of gold bars drops below $1,000 tomorrow). Other people might exercise their option at expiration, and hope that gold is worth more than $1,000 (so they can sell it for a profit or hold on to it long term, if that's their goal).\n\nJust replace \"gold bar\" with \"stock option\" in the example above and that's the general idea.\n\nI didn't realize that most people don't hold options all the way until expiration and instead sell them for a profit until I started trading options. That was a big learning point for me, personally.Now kiss.Can't complain, 4pm and I'm about to crack open a few bottles for a late Zoom Christmas party for work...cheers bud.That\u2019s everyone\u2019s regret when something \ud83d\ude80 to the moon**[Black\u2013Scholes equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\u2013Scholes equation)**\n\nIn mathematical finance, the Black\u2013Scholes equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the price evolution of a European call or European put under the Black\u2013Scholes model. Broadly speaking, the term may refer to a similar PDE that can be derived for a variety of options, or more generally, derivatives. For a European call or put on an underlying stock paying no dividends, the equation is:                                \u2202        V                     \u2202        t                     +                 1       2                    \u03c3            2                    S            2                                           \u2202                  2                        V                     \u2202                S                  2                                     +     r     S                        \u2202        V                     \u2202        S                     \u2212     r     V     =     0         {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial t}}+{\\frac {1}{2}}\\sigma ^{2}S^{2}{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}V}{\\partial S^{2}}}+rS{\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial S}}-rV=0}  where V is the price of the option as a function of stock price S and time t, r is the risk-free interest rate, and             \u03c3         {\\displaystyle \\sigma }  is the volatility of the stock.

I'm long Lockheed, and have been prior to the ARK announcement.\n\n**Summary**\n\n$LMT - Lockheed Martin is one of the largest defense contractors in the US. The US just signed the largest defense budget in history, and Lockheed stands to benefit. Here\u2019s the [text ](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr6395/text)of the bill for reference. Let\u2019s begin.\n\n[About Us Page](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are.html)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8bqhm0isbb61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c5b996a4732a833ab01285664d9b5c7d8d00cf3\n\nA few things to note about Lockheed Martin:\n\n1. Lockheed historically provides conservative earnings estimates, which enable them to consistently beat earnings and raise outlook for the subsequent year\n2. Lockheed carries a backlog of $144b, which enables them to manage production to consistently hit sales targets\n3. Lockheed historically trades at a discount given their expensive low volume contracts. Investors are looking for diversification of revenue and new opportunity given the limited lifecycle of existing investment (e.g. F-35s)\n\nLockheed reports earnings on Jan 26, 2021. Lockheed projects $16.9B in revenue $6.42B in profit.\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse at their most recent earnings:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dq0py12lsbb61.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=de774e12bec9a1d34275f338b807d588970b89ad\n\n**Thesis**\n\nLet\u2019s break this down by vertical for $LMT:\n\n[**Aeronautics**](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/aeronautics.html):\n\nAeronautics is a diverse field for Lockheed, with classic names like F-16 and F-35. Fighter jet contracts are a huge source of revenue and backlogs for Lockheed.\n\nAs we can see for Q3, we saw good revenue numbers at $6.7B and $700m profits, which comes out to an 11% margin.\n\nAeronautics will continue to be a strong category for Lockheed. Here\u2019s a few notes from the recent procurement list in the defense budget:\n\n* F-35 contracts were $700M higher than expectations ($4.5B expected vs $5.2 actual)\n* C-130J was $660M higher than expectations ($30M expected vs $690M actual)\n* F-22 contracts were in line with expectations at $360M (vs $380M expected)\n* F-16 contracts were in line with expectations at $590M (vs $615M expected)\n* Laser technology was given about $200M in funding, which should go to $LMT as new procurement\n   * Here\u2019s a recent contract: [Link](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2021-01-11-Lockheed-Martin-Delivers-HELIOS-Laser-Weapon-System-to-US-Navy-for-Ship-Testing-and-Integration)\n* U-2 Dragon was $16M higher ($16M expected vs $32M actual)\n\nOther highlights that are not highlighted in the defense budget:\n\n* LMT is investing in [Compact Fusion](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/compact-fusion.html) research, which would be used for space travel. Unfortunately we haven\u2019t seen much news here.\n\nAll in all - Lockheed was in line or exceeded expectations in the recent defense bill. While these won\u2019t immediately impact the bottom line, they add to the growing backlog and should signal an earnings beat for this vertical.\n\n[**Missile and Fire Control**](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/missiles-and-fire-control/products.html):\n\nAnother core area for Lockheed is Missile and Fire Control. This area is more difficult to pick out winners and losers in the most recent defense budget. Overall missiles and fire control seems to be in line with expectations.\n\nFor context - missiles and fire control contracts are not as publicized as aerospace. Most of these are upgrades for existing airplanes/helicopters and not explicitly called out in the defense budget by name. Thus we have to assume that budget in line with expectations means that Lockheed should meet expectations in this category.\n\nOther highlights that are not highlighted in the defense budget:\n\n* Did you know that Lockheed is an industry leader in [battery technology](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/energy.html)? Most military installations with clean energy are using Lockheed battery technology.\n* Lockheed does interesting investments in [exoskeleton technologies](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/exoskeleton-technologies.html) for foot soldiers. These contracts haven\u2019t been announced, but should be [$$$. ](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/19/1669201/0/en/Exoskeleton-Market-to-surpass-3-5bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html)\n\n[**Rotary and Mission Systems**](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/rotary-and-mission-systems.html):\n\nThis vertical is super interesting for Lockheed. Representing nearly 25% of revenues, Rotary and Mission Systems references helicopter and other electronic warfare systems (e.g. EMPs and cyber attacks).\n\nThis is another area that doesn\u2019t have public information that we can readily find in the defense budget. There\u2019s plenty of money being thrown at cyber security in the defense budget ($31B), but we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s allocated. Radar systems were also well funded in the recent defense budget, but again it isn\u2019t explicit in allocation.\n\nAs I can\u2019t speak specifically to Lockheed\u2019s performance in this area, here\u2019s a few highlights:\n\n* [Directed Energy](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/directed-energy.html): As part of Lockheed\u2019s laser research, they are building speed of light weapons. Laser research is a huge part of the defense budget (north of $500M in research funding). Lockheed also signed a [$1.2B contract](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2021/01/lockheed-martin-delivers-helios-laser-weapon-system-to-u-s-navy/) for laser technology for Helios lasers.\n* [Hypersonic](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html): I will talk more about this later, but very interesting tech being produced. $800M in funding for research in the latest budget and $100s of millions in other ancillary hypersonic research/deployment.\n\n[Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space.html):\n\nThis is the most interesting vertical for Lockheed and going to be a catalyst for earnings. Lockheed is already cleared for producing spacecraft for landing on the moon, and is currently planning to announce new technology in June for returning people to the moon by 2024.\n\nI highly recommend reading through Lockheed\u2019s website on Space material. This is a new industry for Lockheed and a new line item in the defense budget, and is something investors will be looking at closely. Lockheed needs to diversify their revenues, and Space is an easy way for them to grow - already seeing $2.8B quarterly revenues. They are dominating the Space Force budget, and proving to be leaders in this category.\n\nA few callouts:\n\n1. Lockheed is working with Blue Origin, NOC, and a few other contractors on a human landing system for the moon. This is planned for 2024, but we could hear new information in our upcoming earnings.\n2. Lockheed is focusing on data - satellite technology has been a major focus (for weather, space imaging, and missile technology).\n   1. We\u2019ve seen major contracts in this area too: [Link](https://spacenews.com/lockheed-martin-gets-4-9-billion-contract-to-build-three-missile-warning-satellites/) \\- $5B for missile defense\n\n**Differentiator**: The real reason for this **HIGH** conviction - Lockheed has a few differentiators heading into earnings. Here\u2019s what we should expect to hear more about:\n\n1. 5G and 6G technology - if you didn\u2019t know already, Lockheed is a leader in 5G technology. This week they also trademarked a 6G logo today (Jan 11), which shows they are investing in 6G infrastructure that we will hear about in the upcoming earnings report.\n   1. Historically Lockheed has focused on the satellite deployment contracts for 5G rather than the actual technology. However, recent developments for using 5G to power missiles and drones should push Lockheed to the forefront of 5G technology - even for consumers.\n2. [Hypersonic technology](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html) \\- already a $1B+ line item in the defense budget, hypersonic missiles and aircraft are the future. Traveling at 5x the speed of sound, hypersonic technology has been a major focus for Lockheed, and we should expect major news in the upcoming earnings.\n   1. Lockheed has won major contracts for hypersonic already: [Link](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-08-30-Lockheed-Martins-Expertise-in-Hypersonic-Flight-Wins-New-Army-Work?_ga=2.121726923.1141205913.1610411981-1590128817.1610411981)\n   2. Their latest successful test was on August 8. Lockheed holds an enormous advantage in this category, and should see the bulk of hypersonic contracts moving forward.\n3. Aerojet Rocketdyne - Lockheed recently purchased AJRD for about $5B. Lockheed competes against SpaceX in the reusable rockets space - particular for satellites, and this purchase enables them to have a leg up over SpaceX when it comes to upcoming NASA or Space Force contracts. Costs savings too should be a huge boost. This needs to be approved by President Biden, which we should see news on in the early weeks of his new administration. Super bullish that they are focusing their $18B in M&A dry powder towards Space investments.\n\nInvestors will be looking to the Space line item in the earnings report to evaluate Lockheed\u2019s earnings. The $5B Helios contract should be a huge booster to their revs, and any information on 5/6G and Hypersonic will take Lockheed to the moon.\n\n**Other relevant info:**\n\n* Seeking Alpha: [Link](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397641-lockheed-martin-contracts-surge-to-123-billion)\n* ARK opened a position on Jan 11 for 66k shares (\\~$22m)\n* ARK is creating a space SPAC that will include LMT\n\n**Trades made**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Equity](https://preview.redd.it/mdfz9klxsbb61.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=d60506f0a8a4b0acbf33f06caa453e4a2a3b0100)\n\n[Options](https://preview.redd.it/wdqk2l4usbb61.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b2f0b3503d96bc1003c963fb550b0ac44552a62)\n\nI plan to hold through earnings - an earnings beat should be easy given recent contracts and their backlogs. Historically Lockheed has had bullish activity 2-3 weeks into earnings as people don't want to miss out on them potentially announcing a new contract - 85% of Lockheed's development is classified.\n\nAlso - here\u2019s a few dark pool prints that show you where the money is flowing:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrb0unmnsbb61.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ec57701cf699ef4464e3d065cb485be2d41c513\n\n**Other speculation:** \n\nInteresting speculation heading into earnings for LMT - there's a new generation (6th) airplane being produced by the military that's rumored to be in production by Lockheed's Skunk Works program. If you are not familiar with NGAD - the 6th generation fighter would replace F22s and pave the way for all future stealth fighter contracts for the US Airforce.   \n\n[https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/10/lockheed-building-air-forces-secret-fighter/169408/](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/10/lockheed-building-air-forces-secret-fighter/169408/) \\- here's a brief commentary about comments made by the CFO of LMT. \n\nThey are expecting double digit growth targets for Skunk Works - both through classified aircraft in development and hypersonic missile technology that is also in development. None of these products are expected to be unclassified until 2024-2025, but we could start to hear confirmation of won contracts that would confirm Lockheed's position as leading in Space Force contracts.   \n\nA lot of times there is a run-up into earnings on the potential announcement of deals like this - if Lockheed announced they signed a contract for the next generation of F22s, they'd be immediately signing a 100B+ contract that would ensure earnings beats for the next decade. Same with hypersonic missiles. There's a reason why we are starting to see price action in the weeks ahead of earnings. \n\nLMT also still has $14B in M&A money that could go towards other companies like KTOS or NNDM (for 3d printing of rocket parts). These could be great M&A plays moving forward for Lockheed as they further cement themselves as a leader in the space industry. \n\nI'm also long $NOC for those that are wondering.

Would you say that LMT has any advantage over Northrop, Boeing and Raytheon?Quality post, sorry these morons have no interest in reading it.  I agree LMT is a great company.  In my opinion this is the type of company you actually want to buy and hold.For all the especially autistic members here-\n\nThe tldr is a photo of his positions.  Literally skip the text and look at the photo.First day on this sub? post a TLDR with positions, no one is going to read your dictionarythere could be the fucking cure to cancer in there and im still not gonna read itYo just a heads up, LM is buying Aerojet Rocketdyne within the next few months.  Government already set precedent on allowing vertically integrated monopolies by allowing Northrop to purchase OATK a couple years ago so it shouldn't fuck up the merger.\n\nI've been waiting till next week's paycheck to buy this stock, buy you're onto some shit dude.tldr?I don't know how to read and I couldn't find the positions within 3 seconds, for that reason I'm out.What\u2019s the play here? Calls?If you want to get in cheaper and position yourself in the defense sector check out $DFEN.530c Jan 2022 \n\nLet's fucking goI'm very familiar with LMT and other people in the industry are also really positive on their future development, but what do you really see as an upcoming catalyst to justify calls vs. shares? Those seem aggressively OTM if you're just looking for leverage.Sexy DD. I\u2019m kinda dumb so some is over my head, but I\u2019m definitely saving this post and reading through it better when I have time tonight.You just gave me the confirmation bias I was looking for. I bought them this morning after reading about ARKX and I also saw Canoe has just got them in one of the other ARK. Besides this I looked at their ROE and said it's a must buyLMT literally to the moon and beyond.  I'm inExcellent DD, thank you for taking the time to put it together. What are your thoughts on why LMT has been down trending the last few months? Volume is super low too. \n\nThinking of buying LEAPS tomorrow, they are dirt cheap.The price of LMT increased 228% during Obama/Biden years. For comparison, it increased 136% during the Bush/Cheney years and its only increased about 34% these last 4 years. LMT gave $2.97M to the dems, and $3.22M to the republicans in the last election cycle so they have lots of friends.Top research & DD as per from this user. Bought equity.35 bagger on my weekly BB calls from yesterday what the actual fuckDegiro I presume? I read recently that some Dutch laws ban the trading of several weapon-related stocks. I was going to buy NOC on degiro and it's not available either.US defense contractor. YOU'RE FUNDING THE ENEMY!!!!! Or something like that, I'm sure.LMT is buying Aerojet-Rocketdyne.  They're going to be able to directly compete with Northrop on any SRB contracts going forward.  LMT gets fucked right now on those because they have to bid out the engine/fuel portion to AR/Northrop (who bought AR's main competitor, OATK a year or two ago), so those companies would jack the price up for LMT.\n\nAn interesting play would be to straight up buy AR's shares so they get converted into LMT's shares post buyout.LMT focuses on AI, Lasers, Satellites, Hypersonic, and Rockets - at least in their Space arena. Boeing has too much bad PR and isn't ready to get into Space as quickly as LMT or NOC. RTX is still struggling after their merger and I don't believe will have as much exposure and will lose lots of contracts in space. NOC is another good buy - I'm long them too.I think Northrop has a better margin of safety and potential for growthScared of some actual DD rather than following blindly like the sheep you are? lmfaoI commented about Aerojet. Biden needs to approve, but given his current enthusiasm, that is not a worry.You can reference my positions if you want the tldrI posted my playsDFEN is is mostly BA which is a turd sandwich rn.  Not the move, imo.Too much exposure to BA and RTX. All the ETFs do. I'm long LMT and NOC.I bought 5k worth of calls based on TA (trading at 200ma), following the algo prints that I referenced in my post, and the run up to earnings. I'm also holding 50 shares and plan to add more over time (hoping to get to a few hundred).\n\nCurious though what you've heard from a DD perspective from others in the industry if you care to share.Volume has been down as there's been no news and Biden getting elected has caused money to continue to flow out of defensives into high returning tech stocks. I'm thinking this trend will reverse a bit in the short term, and definitely by June we could see some good price action.Not even the enemy, I\u2019m from the Netherlands. So it probably has something to do with \u2018morals\u2019Not true about Boeing and space.  Boeing has the NASA Docking systems' Soft Capture system.  It's the standard going forward for all docking platforms for future space stations.\ud83d\udc11Didn't see that in my original read.  My bad.Do you see Biden maintaining military spending despite possible democratic pressure? That\u2019s my biggest worry with this play.Too many words I went to a state college, budEdit: moved to comment under OPI was talking to their other people who can\u2019t afford to go long on LMT but still wanna get in on some action. Great write up btw. I\u2019m long as well, but only because they give me free shares every week for being an employee lolWell that's gay.  Sorry you can't join the play.  See you in the next bagger, friend!What are you using? Im using etoro and it works fine with $lmtOf course. We just signed the largest defense deal in ages and there's billions in backlog revenue.Holy shit you went to college?There is a photo of his positions.The pension/employee benefits seem incredible at LMTI\u2019m in.This is the real shocker.

Why? I used to work there. USED TO being the key word. When I joined Babcock and Wilcox in 2017, fresh out of college, the company had a nice budget sheet, plenty of cash, plenty of profits to go around. That all changed within the matter of a few months. A couple projects in Germany had gone wrong. These would be know as the 6 Volund projects that almost bankrupt the entire billion dollar company. These project drove morale down and pushed me to leave the company, as they started getting rid of benefits and it wasn\u2019t looking great as to the future of the company. One of the big hurdles for B&W was closing out those 6 Volund projects and pushing ahead and becoming profitable again. This required a couple CEO changes, which ultimately led to B Riley stepping in and bailing the company out with a huge investment at their \u201crock bottom\u201d and implementing their own CEO. The stock price has been through hell over the years, and had a 10:1 stock split at one point (so the pre split price right now is about $0.45). With the introduction of B Riley, however, the company has done a complete 180. For the first time in almost 4 years the balance sheet is green again, the future is looking bright. I\u2019m writing this DD because this stock/company has hit rock bottom, and now is the time to get back in. I\u2019ve waited 4 years for this moment, I got in at rock bottom during covid (around $0.95) and I see a lot more money to be made. \nI\u2019m giving this stock a rating of \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \nSee you retards on the other side\n\nTendies proof:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rrfS5pT.jpg", "score": 12, "comment": "Or.. you still work there and want a pay raise and thought WSB would be an easy way to trick some tardsWow that 5yr chart.Initially I was thinking you are just another autist, but then I was the Amager Bakke building.

Keep in mind there was a 10:1 reverse split in July of 2019 so everything should be divided by 10.fucking steps to the basement buddyYes! With the ski slope on top. That was one of my favorites. I forgot to mention it in the post but every one of those projects has a guaranteed service contract so that plant is a yearly ROI for BW.I used to say it was Bab and Wil the cock brothers\ud83d\ude02Options or shares?Like a trust autist. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80So they had 6 renewable contracts and tried to do them ALL at once (Mind you they had never tried to do one before and they decided 6 to start was a good idea, and in Germany of all places). Not only did they try to do all 6 at once but they tried to use their own construction team to build them (little to no experience there either, B&W is mostly an engineering/tell people how to build not build themselves). Sufficient to say it was mismanagement to the tune of about half a billion dollars+ after all the projects came in late. After years of paying liquidated damages (for every day that the plants didn\u2019t start on time B&W had to front what the plant would have made in revenue), they finally released the grasp of the projects last year, and refinanced after almost going bankrupt. It took new leadership (B Riley) to pull them out of the shitty situation and get them back on track. The previous management somehow took a profitable half billion dollars in cash and throw it down the drain, as well as go into debt. It was catastrophic to say the least.Out from under those contracts previously mentioned. Finally able to return to profit, and with Biden taking office renewables/green energy are looking good for the future. Stricter EPA regulations make B&W a lot of money in the United States. Management is focusing a lot on the things that are making the company money now.We need to get more retards on board. This has potential to moon.At least the next 2 years. This thing has been beat into the ground and it\u2019s just now getting back on its feet. B Riley has big plans for restructuring and focusing on renewables.I looked also at their Q3 financials, they look dope. It looks like the management turned the boat around and stopped sinkingSharesIts been 18 hours and im not rich yet, ive got all my liquid capital sunk into this,  biden please make diabetes medicine freeDamn what a mess. If they really are out of the woods on that then $4-5 shares are a steal, hopefully the new management team has their shit together. I've been looking for a nuclear play, I think the energy tides are turning that way along with renewables. Good info man, thanks.After doing more research, they seem to have been extremely adversely effected by the Covid lockdowns, suspending employees 401k match, furloughs, deferring tent payments, etc. to conserve cash. On the other hand, the CEO and CFO have bought back tens of thousands of shares over the last monthExactly. Finally positive EPS.. positive EBITDA. It\u2019s insane how B Riley turned the entire company around. I thought they were going to zero for the longest time.The only thing I'm afraid is the high run up recently, but we will see where the value is in the future.

Otherwise, you have to wait for the market to open. If you do a market order, it will be filled as soon as possible. But depending on the volume, you might see a large gap up or down from the pre-hour prices.SharesI don\u2019t even see anything over $40 available for 1/15 on RobinhoodMelvin will be the last one!Read the omniDD\n> Will go to the moon, just buy now\n\n\npurely based on the power of memes?Panic buy back before it's already at $100 thenListen to your orders next time!fgtYeah. \n\nIf we don\u2019t get a flood of sellers, the shorts still need to cover pretty much the entire trade able float. \n\nPlus you have a gamma squeeze which is likely to occur. So your MM will buy more. \n\nIt\u2019s a rocket about to fly.how do you get shares pre-market?already aboard with shares, want to get into calls. would 40c 1-29 still be decent?If i knew how to make video memes i would do the springtime for hitler oneStfu you gay bear \ud83c\udf89Okay so I should wait for market open to do the order right? Like right at 9:30, as opposed to queuing one in robinhood right now?Yeah I too believe it will spike and I've been watching the premarket movement, the thing is that as far as I'm aware, queuing up a market buy order on RH is worse than simply placing an order myself at 9:30 correct? Again, new retard, need to get a lesson on these small details.XnetStraya here \ud83d\ude4b hmu for a yarn at midnight hehYea bro. Me and the boys have the alarm set at 3.25 fo our moves. Sitting at 70 shares I\u2019m moving another 3000usd in. Maybe half it out through the day.Sure but very hard to predict. Will Probably wait a few minutes after market open to see how it is going and then decideThank you that makes sense! Really appreciate itWhy not the calls? It seems like they\u2019re more profitable right?\"You underestimate my power!\" - Anakin SkywalkerThere are still a ton of shorts to squeeze, most of yesterday\u2019s volume was high frequency trading.Banks did their DD overnight, realized there was actually safety from bankruptcy after leaving it for dead. They also see the short squeeze, and will now ride it.FactsEasy 100%. No fucking way it won't go to at least 80puts expire friday right?Well, I am German and this is traded in Germany. This is for me not really pre market.Double down in shares. Make it impossible for Melvin to cover ANY of his shortsDude idk I'm buying on euros and baught yesterday for 26 after I sold for 27 and baught today for 30 some more \ud83d\ude02Look the issue with a market order (blind at open) is that the actual price u get might be quite high if there are dips through out the day or usually around quarter of day. But again you're not day trading, the idea with buying now is 1) Believing this thing will explode short term to 60+, then ur entry price doesn't really matter 2) You're holding long term to 100+ and the squeeze doesn't really matter. The issue with the limit order is that if it isn't high enough to actually match a bid you'll be stuck with the price flying, and will have to constantly modify the order with a new price. So, it all depends on your thesis. The idea I think is if you're getting in today price at open should theoretically not matter that much. Even if it dips, it should moon again. But if you think the squeeze already happened, then you shouldn't be getting in today at all.I want to know this too. How tf do premarket orders work?Fuck bro. I\u2019m at 3.30 market open here. It\u2019s brutal.im aussie too you using etoro? \n\nI changed my 1000USD shares at 19 to 5x leverage before market close. \n\nPre market making me cum because now im definitely not hitting the short stop losses etoro sets at X5Hope you're enjoying the gains. Don't get out too early, still plenty of legs on this thing!Isn't that the point of the limit order?  You don't predict you set your happy price and let it run.  If it doesn't happen oh wellbecause Melvin needs to bleed...to get our tendies to the moon and beyond \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Now we need to own shares and hold to raise price. With options you don't own the sharesI\u2019m trying to ask the same lolSource?Yeah. But there is also a gamma squeeze and probably more puts expiring later. It will be vicious.Just buy asapOkay very good info to know, but that wasn't exactly what I was trying to deduce. I was literally wondering what price robinhood will buy the stock at if I place a pre-market order. Will it execute the order exactly at 9:30 for exactly what the price of the stock is at open, or can I expect some sort of delay and see the price go up before my queued buy order is executed? Robinhood allows pre-market trading at 9:00 so if I want to get in on executing my buy order as soon as possible, I should wait until 9:00 and manually execute the buy order then correct? \n\nIt's more a question about the mechanics of pre-market trading rather than the stock itself, my expectation is that the squeeze has either not fully started or still has a ways to go, and so I would like to buy in today as soon as possible. Essentially does it make more sense to buy manually at 9:00AM/9:30 or should I just queue the order now in robinhood and trust that it will accomplish this itself.well, for once there are of course the non-US markets which operate in different time zones..kiwi bro,don\u2019t have a margin account. Would have to pay tax if I did anyway. No tax on shares from capital.Yea she\u2019s good. Fucking app done me in. Bought 1k at 37 and 1.5k at 35. In for a penny in for a pound mate.Sure they are, but by buying shares you\u2018ll add fuel to the short-squeeze.. but go an buy calls if you want toShares so shorts can\u2019t cover and we moon. Get bothCan you explain Gamma squeeze to someone who understands what gamma is but is too dumb to figure out why it squeezes and what the effects ?Idk about how premarket on RH works, but with my broker and I assume many  a premarket market order at open on a stock thats up premarket usually jumps a bit right at open and u get a worse price than the delayed data shows (from my experience). So I mean, if you already can start ordering at 9. Go with a limit order of a few percent above whatever is the price then. See if you can get in before open, if not then just blind it at open and YOLO. Again, I expect a small dip for sure to occur sometime after open like an hour or two in so I've decided to drop half at open and half ill day trade. But again with that thesis shouldn't matter at all tbh.In very simple terms. Market makers are forced to buy shares to balance their hedge. This occurs when there are huge changes in option markets which is what we have seen.Bro thank you, this is exactly the sort of information I was looking for.

If I just listened to the autists I would have doubled my money on market orders alone.Hold strong, GME holders. Shorts were sweating at $25. Now at >$36 they're completely fucked.

Like do you use a specific app, what\u2019s the difference between stocks/calls etc? Wouldn\u2019t mind throwing a few quid in but have zero fucking idea how to get startedI have 30/c that expires tomorrow. I missed the 38 mark today so was hoping it hits 38 again so I can sell the option. You think we getting there again today.... tomorrow!?Someone is buying over 200k shares at 36.gg boiz bought a bunch of calls and then $14.23 of shares with my leftoversMelvin Capital?

Now I have 200% original money to buy yolo calls.I hopped off the GME train to get on the BB train, but will be enjoying my tendies tonight watching this movie.This should be right on the front page of wallstreetbets WE ARE NOT PLAYING \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I'm a high functioning autist, some of the math was offThis is WSB Perfection\ud83d\udc4cu/savevideoTuesday\u2019s mark to market is going to be painful for Melvin, they will have to bring in fresh capital to cover their losses or buy to cover, this ain\u2019t over. House call if they dip below 35% and an immediate exchange call at 25% equity. They might be able to stretch it out but they will have to sell something to cover or bring in more trendies.I don't own any GME but these meme are something else\ud83d\ude02My favorite movie and scene of all time.yo i bought at 38 does that mean 0% for me then??GME gang welcomes every bagholder \ud83d\udcbcShould i go in with a leverage x2 maybe just to get as many shares as possible?Wait, is Melvin winning? What is going on? Retreat?We're all selling at open and using the gains for more PLTR?First of all it's Macedonians in English and Makedones in Greek(-lish). Makedonians doesn't exist.\n\nThey were considered savages by the Athenians just like the Athenians were considered boy lovers by the Spartans. City states weren't in the best of terms at the time and political rivalry between them doesn't change their ethnic composition. Theyre all descendants of the same tribes give or take, speak the same language and believe in the same cultural traditions.\n\nMoreover, Philip was actually from Argos.May I ask why are people doing this considering all the news around game stop and where the company is actually headingCan you make a part 2 of this meme where that paper hand cripple ass mf leads the Persians behind the Spartans? Cause that's going down rnIs someone gonna post the scene after this?Y\u2019all know how this movie ends right?I mean I like it but you do know how that movie ended right?Lol don\u2019t they all die in the end?I finally bought in.  THis shit better do something!!!Wow the short squeeze last two days\n\nYou did it boyztake my survey u fuckers \n\nhttps://forms.gle/yMHg75RNn9ggipet7Can some one explain to an idiot like me what\u2019s going on with Melvin capital?Not gonna lie WSB scares me sometimes. Seems the whole point is to lead this sub off of cliffs. The short term gains are glorious but I can\u2019t see any future this stock doesn\u2019t crash after the artificial bubble pops. I like your style tho. That shit is cute.Can someone explain what happened here? Why is it up 100% in 2 days?Don\u2019t... don\u2019t the Spartans lose at the end \ud83e\udd7aUmmm, doesn't this end bad for us?Someone explain I'm stupidDon't we all die at the end tho...FUCK MELVIN GME YOLO GANG\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ugh!

He told the tale1. You get a broker. Fund your account. If you're only using \"a few quid,\" then you'll want a discount broker like Robinhood. (Not sure what's available in the UK.)\n2. If you want to get involved in \"this sort of thing\" (i.e., what WSB does), just pick stocks you think will shoot up and buy some short-term call options. You need an options account to do that. Basically, you'll want to figure out how to calculate the leverage of positions you're considering (\\[delta \\* stock price\\] / call price). More is better if you think it will shoot up.\n3.

Do you own workShhhhh don\u2019t use that word it\u2019s just about memes rememberIt\u2019s a meme to buy GME, not manipulation jeez, that\u2019s boomer talk we millennials and Gen z up in this shitNo, this is using the rules of the game against the elite who used sketchy mechanisms to sell more of something than actually existed to screw over average investors.  They sold more GME shares than they could technically own.  One of ours saw a cheap company and is making something good out of it and we are in it because it makes more sense to us than the garbage reports Citron or Hindenberg put out.  Those guys are market manipulators.No.  \u201cSqueezing\u201d an over sold short actually brings the stock to a more fair market balance. \n\n\nSelling more shares of a company than the number of shares that exist is potentially manipulation and does not help the market come to a fair valuation.  \n\n\nThe argument is that they essentially diluted the fair market value by over selling the shares.  \n\n\nSo, it\u2019s a free market righting itself, by saying \u201coh if those are worth $x diluted, then when the dilution is removed they should be worth more\u201d.  It\u2019s math. It\u2019s free market.  \n\n\nTo stop that, or regulate buying over shorted stocks, would be diminishing the free market.

Us seeing an overextended fund, engaged with an even shadier insitutions behind them, capitalizing on them is not illegal.  That's savvy.\n\nWhen stated institutions are *naked short selling* shares that *don't exist*, sir, that is illegal.  Of course, its already been mathematically proven beyond a reasonable doubt that is exactly what they were doing, so, at that point, they squeezed the shit out of themselves.  *Of course* they were going to get long squeezed by the same autistic retards as well.  Why the hell not?  Those options were juicy as shit.  Unlike them, the people selling those calls *are covered by shares and/or cash*.  The callers don't have to borrow anything.  So you can see a scenario, where someone like me, whom sees a situation where I can literally make 10% return *of my entire portfolio* in two god damned days *with little to no risk* who has a fuckton of capital selling .  Well, you can see where those call sellers are coming from.  Besides the shorts pathetically to unload -20k puts in a way that doesn't get them prosecuted/bankrupt, you got us, the *savvy* ones gobbling up literal *tens of thousands of shares* to turnaround.\n\nThat all adds up to a squeeze.  That is simple market dynamics.  But, the important part, is *who was doing the illegal thing that led to perversion that led to this situation*.  That sir, is the insitutions who were naked short selling.  Feel free to report 'em to the SEC.  Most of us already did.... how dumb can a company be?  They are facing off against not only 1.8m autist, but also any trading firm that secretly watches us from the  shadows.So I think that means somebody was selling calls (another way to short a stock), but seemingly bought up the volume to close that position out (this demand spiked the price). Basically, it means the short squeeze if fully on because the shorts are starting to flip.Nvm, for some reason, Indians cannot invest in US derivatives.

It depends on your own circumstances.IV is one of the metrics used to price options. GME IV is insanely high so premium is expensive.

I don\u2019t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.\n\n$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn\u2019t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I\u2019m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Case: \n\n1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  \n\nThe digital game sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the \ud83d\udc3b are right, but they\u2019re right in 8 years which means they\u2019re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more\npeople go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don\u2019t care about the fractionally\nlarger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. \n\nBlockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster\u2019s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster\u2019s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.\n\nGamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  \n\nEveryone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.\n\n2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt\n\nThis is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.\n\n3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.\n\nGamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.\n\nGamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a \"digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment\"\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Case\n\nThis MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  \n\nThis has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you\u2019re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don\u2019t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  \n\nSimply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?\n\n\nTLDR:  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 But not because of the MOASS.", "score": 103, "comment": "**If this is [spam](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide) you can vote to remove it and earn setting your own flair.**\n\n| **Remove It (0)** | **Keep It (1)** |\n|--------|:-------|-------:|:------:|\n| [Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=kyyoa0&message=spam) | [Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=kyyoa0&message=approve)|\n\n[Click Here to Change Inaccurate Post Flair](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=WSBVoteBot&subject=postflair%20CHANGEME&message=kyyoa0)\n___\n ^comment ^will ^disappear ^--- ^21 ^shitposts ^removed ^since ^last ^crash ^--- ^[information](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot) ^--- ^[leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard) ^--- ^[REWARDS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot_commands)I\u2019m doubling down on Tuesday. \ud83d\ude80>They\u2019re pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.\n\nRyan Cohen follows *only* 4 accounts on Twitter: WSJ, Financial Times, Geekwire, and.........**PC GAMER**.\n\nHe knows **exactly** what he\u2019s doing.\n\nShorts and gay bears are absolutely fucked.

As soon as any news comes out that GME is on a turnaround they will eat each other alive to get out.As an inexperienced trader, the build up to the big squeeze has been very stressful\u2014despite the obvious, massive opportunity, I\u2019m convinced I\u2019ll find a way to cuck myself into little or no profit. I\u2019ve seriously developed an uncontrollable and absolutely infuriating eye twitch from thinking about it.\n\nI\u2019ve read god knows how many $GME posts over the past week and none of them provided the kind of cathartic confirmation bias you\u2019ve just given me. Because, whence the squeeze hath been squozzed, this will still be a great company, with great leadership and a bright future and that\u2019s something I want to be a part of. \n\nGME REENTRY AFTER I GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE MOON \ud83d\ude80Long live Cohen. Long live Roaring Kitty. Long live Rod. Long $GMEThe only point you need:\n\nA digital download of Cyberpunk was $60. A physical copy for PC with the OST officially printed, with stickers, box art, a physical map and a necklace of Samurai\u2019s logo was $60.\n\nWho got the better value?\u201cThe digital sales argument, like all \ud83d\udc3b arguments, is weak\u201d\n\nSomebody give this man an awardWell written, rational DD.  Thank you.Bro dont you ever put GME and Blockbuster in the same DDThis guy's last post was 7 years ago and about japanese watches. I don't knows seems fishyToo many wordsI don\u2019t understand how they think there will be a digital store.  \n\nIf I want to download a new ps4 game.... it comes from the PlayStation store.  There\u2019s no reason why they would add a middle man like GameStop for a download actually makes zero sense.Go back to r/stocks with this garbage DDValue stocks? Idk sounds kinda gay to meSame here. What\u2019s another thousand now when we\u2019re literally going to the moon \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80If you bought shares sit back and enjoy the ride. Remember you\u2019re not the one on borrowed time, shorts are. We have no time limit. We\u2019re playing a staring contest but shorts don\u2019t realize we\u2019re blind (and retarded).I have no idea what GME will do if it does squeeze, but it might not be just a rise and it sets there.  Or it might.   Point being I think some people will be caught off guard, depending on what it does.   If the squeeze is more gradual then it's going to be like boiling a frog -- so slow you may not recognize it.   If the squeeze is sudden, you may miss it by holding out too long before it dips down (provided it dips down).  I think the VW squeeze only lasted 4 or so days as a massive sharp spike before the price came way down (and never returned to peak squeeze price).\n\nThis could be tricky if you're trying to predict the absolute top.   I can't tell you what to do as I'm not a financial advisor or expert, but I already have limits set to auto sell my shares at various prices in chunks.  I won't be kicking myself if it shoots much higher though, because really gain is gain in my book.  As long as I don't sell below my average cost I'm pretty happy.\n\nI do wonder if this is going to last months until the next Earnings Report or if it will be sooner.   (Or if it never truly squeezes in the way we are expecting)You know what else is long?  \ud83c\udf46Honestly, the digital copy is more valuable to me. IDGAF about stickers and art and I do like not having to leave the house.Check the price of the other watch I posted.thats what the TLDR is forSteam, epic launcher, blizzard... games are more then console.If you're bad at thinking, try reading things that smarter people have thought of.\n\n1. Cross-platform downloads. That's right, it can be downloaded and played on PC and consoles for one cost.\n\n2. Money back on digital \"returns\" means less of a cost commitment than literally any other download service.\n\n3. Physical stores switching to PC-building stores, which opens up custom builds to the majority of people who are too dumb and/or lazy to build one themselves.\n\nMicrosoft just agreed to give GME a percentage of *all* downloads from the Microsoft store. Do you really think your 30 seconds of \"thought\" is smarter than all of Microsoft's management? GME is going to be the comeback of the decade, and everyone knows it except for Melvin and people like you.I think memberships are key. Not sure if that\u2019s in their plan, but it could potentially play a huge role in how they incentivize people to buy. If they make enough from subscribers, the games could come with a lower price tag. Almost everything is subscription based now days. I could be wrong though.I believe they are also getting a cut of all digital sales in the xbox shop for xboxes sold through Gamestop.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_comingBecause they\u2019re shifting their focus from software to hardware. I highly doubt they\u2019re thinking $GME is going to be selling digital copies of games online as their main source of revenue.I bet you\u2019ve got \ud83e\uddfb\u270bhands tooThe digits in our bank accounts as Melvin and BoA die from a thousand cuts.Many of us want the most for our money and you bought a broken game.One that hasn\u2019t been mention partaking part of E-sports idkCan\u2019t Stop!", "linkFlairText": "DD", "totalAwardsReceived": 2, "rating": 3.3747891713709457}, {"id": "kyyg41", "stockTicker": "TLRY", "title": "$TLRY \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selfText": "", "score": 18, "comment": "APHA is where the real  **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** are2/19 20c and 3/19 22cGod speed autist.

Fucking idiotI ll be long gone\" says the guy with the grey hair.Rotated into $ROPEI mean I feel like people here forget that these type of people and institutions don't go all in like us retards. They probably follow the Kelly Criterion Formula and play no more than 5% in one play.I\u2019m assuming he just held until expiration, sold the shares at $20, and made a profit. Obviously, not the profit he would have made if he just held the shares. But no moron is going to sell calls at a lower strike than what he paid for the shares, so he still sold higher than he bought inThe hidden truths of wall st: They are all as stupid as we are.He's a fucking boomer. He's doesn't get that the world moved on from his boomer bullshit 15 years ago. He probably prints his emails and files them under correspondence.Usually if they are strongly opposed to a stock, they are somehow financially invested in that opinionSemi-related: The 07-09 bloodbath was interesting, as it was the first real big crash to happen with a somewhat mature internet-as-we-know-it today in place. \n\nAll sorts of investing sites had blowhards, ham-and-eggers, fakers, frauds, hypers and retards posting article after article, basically as one-eyed men in the valley of the blind. A bunch of zero-insight droolers mindlessly repeating the most inane investing maxims, and how so-forth was your last chance to get in on a \"gamechanger\" or an \"undervalued SWAN stock\".\n\nThen, the crash happened, then they just vanished. Poof. They once had an audience who listened, then, when the tide went out and everyone saw they were swimming totally naked, so they just stopped posting. Many deleted their accounts, their articles... Since that time, social media really came around and every now and then, I look them up. \n\nOne big talking former article-writer is now a bank teller. Another, an HVAC guy. A couple \"certified financial planners\", some \"cryptocurrency investors\", \"domainers\", etc. These were dudes with bio pics in suits and ties who once confidently told others how to invest their money when the rising tide raised all ships but once actual skill/insight/knowledge was required, they just quietly went away and back to incredibly mediocre day jobs. \n\nSo, other than PLTR to the moon, be careful who you listen to. At least WSB doesn't take itself seriously. \nDon't take anyone seriously who doesn't post their own performance.> Does every single \"financial guru\" really have no idea wtf they're doing? Or are they all just this stubborn?\n\nyes.YES! everyone is absolutely convinced its already died and don't truly see the potential GME has to transition because they really do NOT understand the gaming industry. It's hilariously sad to watch.Yep stubborn and sometimes don't know shit about technology.Of course he does he's a fucking boomer. They have all the cash they stole from the future generations. We'll make him lose it all thoughis this the explanation for what's going on with Melvin's short position too? They're rolling that 55M in puts over to some future date at a new strike ?Gone like his hairline.One of us and he doesn\u2019t even know it... yet \ud83d\ude02That\u2019s why he was selling weeklies...Read what he said again.Typically selling weeklies is pry smart not here thoLolWhat do you guys think about 50 dollar calls for Tuesday? Or just get more shares?\n\nEdit: never mind will buy more shares and maybe 1 or 2 callsFNever. We all make our choices, and must lie in them good or bad. They ecannot be mourned. They must learn, and grow as most of us did. Mourn not those that never stood a chance. Rejoice when they are born again as \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32Go back through your history and post that shit up, the only thing that excites me more that hot milf porn is retard gain porn, and the only thing that excites me more than that is boomer loss porn.Go on ...Selling naked calls is more retarded than the yolo calls we buy into hereThere are girls in this sub? LolFSometimes it feels like the more and the louder the autism leaks, the more the dying dumb boomers feel like they need to prove themselves. That's when they get rekt and give us our money back. And I'm okay with it.Someone posted it is 138% as of 1/15Sounds like officially it is updated every two weeks but other data services try to estimate it between thenThey don't realize their time has come and gone. All they have is the wealth they stole from the future generations. WSB will have him eating out of a garbage can soon.As he sold naked calls he could lose 100*(current share price -premium-20) * amount of contracts. So if someone exercised em at like the peak of 43 $ he would lose like 2000 dollars per contract he soldIf he was truly selling naked calls, the losses could theoretically be infinite. It just depends how many contracts he actually sold.i dunno about the 20c's specifically but some of the higher strikes (like 30c's) were up over 50,000% after a couple days.\n\nThey went from a premium from pennies to dollar amounts so go figure. There are retail traders out there that are undoubtedly bankrupt from this week. Collecting as little as $5K in premiums from naked calls \"that were never going to print\" would leave them with a loss in the 7 figures (well they've be liquidated before it reached that point, but yeah it will blow up an account)wait, but if you had GME calls, why did you lose 25k?It hasn't yet.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366\n\nHasn\u2019t happened yet.Over on the gamestop subreddit, full of gamestop employees, Cohen has a bad reputation because of his plan to shutter most of the brick and mortar stores.\n\nI'm not very confident in GME long term either, but don't straight up ignore fundamental changes.Who cares about long term about this company. Sell at the peak and move onto the next stock.Cohen will convert it into an online mega gaming palace. Think about it...tons of gaming stuff and no refrigerators or other crap to sift through. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80don't be a doucheCool it with the anti Semitic remarksI did it for youHe exercised so that means he owns the 1000 shares.he didnt close the contract, he exercised it (actually turned in the option ticket for 100 shares), so you could say that he \"made\" the money but its still in the shares (i fucking hope OP)Calls with a strike price of $20KOBRA KAI never die!!!Underrated comment, we really should do that. And you know what's the transport to get there :rocket:Like Epstein island, but instead of children there\u2019s cocaine.This is the gotdamn way!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8This dude has some fascination for sure. Except from his profile picture, that mofo smokes Black N Milds and most of us WSB retards are about to set off some fucking Gurkha Royal\u2019s!!! \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Dude boomers fucking LOVE shitty cigars. It\u2019s one of the tell-tale signs.Basically, does Andrew Shapiro look like someone who know anything about video games, gamer culture, or the video game industry? you wouldn't take his advice on whether to buy a PS5 or a Series-X so why on earth would you take his advice on selling close to the money naked calls on a company with a turn around story like this? fucking boomers.\n\nHis opinion is shit, because he doesn't know shit.Right! Amateurs. I saw a seeking alpha article that said why xpev will surge, and then posted THE SAME DAY was another seeking alpha article saying why xpev will go down. TFyeah, sometimes they have some reasonable articles on certain hype stocks like QS or hydrogen stocks. I personally like it because it provides a decent balance to my usual extremely bullish hydrogen/green energy news sources.He probably does now$RopetatedI forget that outside these hallowed walls, yolo is not the norm, however, 'huge vol prem' on naked calls though. Might be in a tad bit more than 5%...They're stupid but we're fucking retarded!!!!!You don\u2019t?He prints charts to literally draw with crayons on themI thought the SEC requires that for everyone that made $6.34 on an options play onceThat's super interesting. Never thought about those people leaving the industry in a downturn, but it makes sense. Just shows that anyone can claim to be an expert when it's super easy to make money in a market.This should be printed and put on a fucking shirt. BeautifulI'm still feeling really good about pltr, I don't understand the recent negativity I've seen here.  Nothing has changed except people saying it went \"sideways for a week\", even though it closed 5% up. Probably salty their shitty 1/15 $40c weren't miraculously printing already.> don't truly see the potential GME has to transition because they really do NOT understand the gaming industry.\n\nWhat do you see that the bears don't?I'm not a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, promise -- but I'm curious what GME's plans are? I missed the initial post that sparked all this and have just been seeing \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nLike, last I heard they got My Body is Reggie and were planning on like being sort of \"internet cafe/hangout\" places -- is that still a thing? Have they done anything along those lines yet, or is it still just all talk?\n\nObviously (to my eyes) they can't continue their current used games business model if the gaming industry transitions to streaming/digital downloads (hence the newer consoles not even having disk drives), but there must be something I'm missing.\n\nHow do they compete as a brick-and-mortar when a lot of the market is going to Steam/Xbox/Sony's digital stores, or if Stadia-esque streaming becomes a regular thing in 5-10 years? Again, I'm genuinely curious; I missed the initial DD on this one.loseI don't know any rich boomers.  Most worked for decades at a 9-5 and retired modestly.  It's not like that whole generation is filthy rich and conspired against future generations.  That's some tinfoil hat level stuff there.\"stole from future generations\"... Lol. A bit jealous? Nothing Wong with hard work.Too stupid for hereDon't worry, you're in the wrong sub if you think he will understand, GUHThe fact that his comment has so many upvotes is disturbingFThanks GhandiFuck yeahYou bet.Dumbass.And you boys make me laugh out loud and give great advice if you know who to follow. \ud83d\ude09FTill the SEC for whatever reason decides to fuck this sub over for market manipulation. We can be retarded here in the sub, we don't have to go scream WSB it everywhere. Sub is full or 15y olds these days.Thank you fellow tard.Yeah that was my quick math as well. I figure he lost at least $1500/contract if they didn't exercise at the peak, but he supposedly sold multiple contracts. Sure would be a shame if his losses were in the 5 figures.\n\n\nAnd by shame, I mean hilarious.He sold themhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366 \n\nHasn\u2019t happened yet.> Cohen has a bad reputation because of his plan to shutter most of the brick and mortar stores.\n\nTo be fair they have waaaaay too many stores, when you hear stories of two gamestops in a single mall then they should be shutting stores, they are as bad as starbucks.Which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Closing stores might be good to maximize profit.Thank you friendsthanks, like I said i\u2019m a fucking retard.We will fuck his wife and her boyfriendim taking my own fucking rocket to at least a mil. see you in greece or bahamas!Woah guy, you flying too close to the sun on this one.it seems everybody with the name Shapiro is retardedI'm not sure Gamer Culture has a lot to do with the market thesis hereIdk he looks broke to me. RIPYou really need to stop with this boomer trash talk.  i'm one, and no, I don't know a thing about the video game industry, but I learned a lot about GME from u/deepfuckingvalue.  I'm long 1000 shares.  Dr. Burry is a boomer too, and he's long a few more than I am.  We're in this together.  Ease up dude.It's basically a message board. Market manipulators can go on there and post what they want. So it's not surprising to see contradictory posts.I'm just basing the 5% off of what the experiment suggests id say maybe up to 20-25% would be the most they would play and probably not on a short position but who knows maybe they have just a touch of downs.tards like us, but with suits.No i print them out and scan them in. I'm not an idiot!!!Thanks for the laughmy 2/5 40c is doing well rn, kinda wanna sell it and get in on the GME hype, but im a small fry so it would be literally 1 share of gme or like 2 calls lol\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are too busy finger popping each other\u2019s assholes to play gamesIt\u2019s not what I see and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s about how they can see the same news and have a completely different perspective. They\u2019ve been assuming GameStop is going to go bankrupt for the last 10 years. \n\nThey only see what they want at this point. \n\nThe bears have nothing new that\u2019s in their favor. Bulls are the only ones that have news that\u2019s in their favor.He\u2019s just describing old guys bungholeOk boomerOk boomerWe actually make money on GME hereYou're welcome. I got your back.FCorrect. It hasnt happened. \n\nThe short interest literally only went up, not down. You know that right?Remember back in march when gamestop decided that their employees were *essential workers*? Everybody's freaking out about the plague and these guys got stuck dragging themselves to work without any PPE or clear preventative measure or nothing.\n\nThey're people getting fucked over by the pandemic that need a job. If you know anybody who's tried to find a job in the last year, you know how harrowing it is. And if somebody gets infected in your household and you're on the hook for the bill for a ICU stay? You're fucked. How do you pay rent? utilities? food? And now a new board wants to come in, lay everybody off and move the business online.\n\nIn most narratives, we're the bad guys here. We're the greedy investors that scream at the board cuz WE WANT TENDIES NOW.\n\nJust something to think about.Welcome homei dont remember this line in the show but i like itMakes him perfect for the sub, shouldn\u2019t we have our professionals recruiting this man for rocket fuel?Boomer is more of a mindset than an age.\n\nI know many completely retarded and close-minded 30 and 40 year olds that I consider to have the boomer mindset and I know 60 and 70 year olds that are cool as fuck that I\u2019d never in a million years call a boomer. Like you sir.> Dr. Burry is a boomer too\n\nMichael Burry is gen x\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c\n\nedit: wow, you tried talking about getting this sub shutdown because you took offense to the word retard, you really are a boomer.So it's like a less openly retarded WSB?Sometimes I put on a suit and tie and sit on the toilet  on my phoneThen what do you put in your file cabinet?This made me chuckle. Thank you.BrilliantIt's the only thing that 'might' make him money, it's pretty obvious he isn't making any money on the share market.LuicySuch a predictable, lame response lol.Lets be real this is like the one time in years.FYes I do!

I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they \"have\" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:\n\n**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**\n\n**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among \"3-4 others in the state\" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as \"PC building stations\".**  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.\"**\n\nNow, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. \n\nHOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty \"in-the-know\" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!\n\nShe also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the \"Next blockbuster!1!!!\" thesis.\n\nPersonally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.\n\n\nPositions: 250 shares @22.30 cost avg, 2x 4/19/21 $30c, 2x 01/29/21 $50c\n\n(Somebody on mobile add the rockets pls)\n\nETA69: Somebody showed me how to do the rockets \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 LFG!!!\n\nETA420: DON'T GIVE ME GOLD, KEEP THAT MONEY AND FUCKING BUY GME SHARES\n\nETA from one of the commenters below, u/theodros1:\n\n\"Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores. The 1.5 stores will be more \"PC oriented\" and will allow users to choose parts. He didn't confirm \"PC building stations\" but dropped an amazing tidbit. The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.\n\nedit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the \"Cohen news hasn't materialized yet\"... I said him being \"CEO\" and he grunted, I think affirmatively\n\nedit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about \"reset\" of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5\n\nedit 3: Found a 1.5 station, he confirmed OP's post. There will be gamestop stores where we can build out our whole PC in store. Didn't have balls to ask about Cohen as CEO though lol\"", "score": 878, "comment": "GME pivoting to become a bunch of tiny microcenter stores would be dope.THIS IS HUGE!!!  Genius play too. Inspiring the next generation to build PCs, then funnel the new customer base to their online game platform.

You\u2019ve now graduated and can ride a big school bus nowhmmmm I was a blockbuster analogist BUT if this true AND they are going to hire legit nerds (sorry, but you can\u2019t train people to know every little thing about PC components unless they\u2019re passionate) this could be huge. The closest thing I can get to this is Fry\u2019s Electronics and I live in LA. It\u2019s pathetic.\n\nedit: \ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffc \ud83d\ude80?Did we break the news before the co?

Gamestops in areas outside my state claimed that 1.5 stores were simply larger and had more room to carry supply but did not involve \"building stations.\" One clerk claimed that while they were transitioning to  PC parts, he did not see any stores being building stations. Take this all for what's it worth.This is actually huge, see people don\u2019t understand the niche of the gaming market. They want to buy and support someone who understands them. GameStop revolutionizing themselves into a one stop bestbuy but nerdier is going to be huge and that doesn\u2019t consider all the e-commerce\n\nThat and computers are like phones, everyone wants the latest and greatestI would, 100% build at a kiosk, especially if there were physical representations of things like cases available to see and touch in store. I dislike trying to visualize exactly what it is I'm buying online, worrying about fit and finish or if the GPU is going to be too big for the case or any of that bullshit.\n\nTl:Dr sign me up, GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n$3K MORE ON TUESDAY\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Do they have margaritas on Mars?Walked into a local GameStop can confirm.

They\u2019re sold out of virtually everything at GameStopDE, most  new  booster packs (champions path, vivid voltage etc. were sold out in the first hour. GameStop is already the #1 location for Pok\u00e9mon releases in Germany  since the only other stores getting those packs are one man card shop businesses. There\u2019s another big release coming up In February (shining fates). I\u2019m certain GameStop is in a similar position in the US. Those packs are even reselling at double MSRP, there\u2019s huge potential for GameStop if they manage to secure more stock and sell the hyped booster packs in bundles with less hyped booster packs to profit off of that. I went in store at GameStop 3 days after the release and the clerk told me I was the 25th person to ask him about that booster pack already. I\u2019ll try to find out how many boxes of SF they get if the store is opened again next month (current lockdown). People are saying GameStop is dying but really they are in a good position selling PC parts, games and collectibles like Pok\u00e9mon cards and funko pops.

If he's looking to grow the company, the best way to not only send a message and to get the shorts off the back of the company is to make damn sure the squeeze occurs. ON TOP OF THAT, the amount of brand spanking new loyal consumers that will 100% use their new found money on product and services the store offers if this is successful is gigantic. The free marketing, the loyalty, the brushing off of pressure, all of that would pave a clear road towards Chewy 2.0.\nRyan I hope you're reading this.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80hmmmmmm wasn\u2019t convinced till now but after this i might have to hop on the retard rocketIf Cohen is announced as CEO i might bussThat\u2019s it.

FUCK IBP. Estimated ship date was last week, the only thing they've done in 6 weeks is process my payment. I'd cancel but I feel like at this point a decent company might take longer then IBP will.My local GameStop is always busy and has been for years. I don\u2019t know why people think it\u2019s like block buses. Oh wait, yes I do. It\u2019s because they are retarded.I told my buddy about GME and he said the same thing about pokemon packs - the new ones are completely are sold preorders (Shining Fate boosters). Shorts are fucked\n\nedit: went out to a couple gamestops looking with him, found no pokemon cards of any kindCan confirm average mid range pc is around 600-800$ And those just for entry level these things can easily go over 4K$ GME to the moonWhat if this was supposed to be announced at the IRC and got pulled for some reason. And the manager assumed it was already public knowledge?now imagine if they had employees persuade people into getting online GME game passes that can get you a whole lot of PC games for a monthly fee. we are actually going to the moon boysI will literally drop 10k buying two gaming PCs at GameStop when this happens.\n\nBuying more shares on Monday.

I cannot tell you how frustrating it can be to order PC parts off the internet.  Package delays, damaged product. Or it just doesn't work and you have to go through the hassle of returning the DOA product for a refund and wait another week for your part to arrive while your brand new partially finished PC collects dust.\n\nThere are no in store retailers near me that sell parts and i'm forced to go through someone like Amazon.  I've been itching for a large retailer where i can just walk in and pick my parts at the store and build my new computer THAT DAY.\n\nFucking hell, i'm getting hard at the though of it.  I don't think people realize how many cities across America don't even have a microcenter or anything of the like they can just walk into.\n\nThere is a massive untapped market of retail buyers itching for something like this and they don't even know it yet.  Who knows, 4 or 5 years from now instead of kids lining up to buy the next gen consoles, they will be lining up at gamestop to build their first computer.Glad to see they are making moves. \ud83d\ude80Dude, this makes so much sense.Can confirm the PC stuff, they keep empty boxes bc their shit sells out pretty quickly\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I was literally talking to my co worker about how GME should do this then this post comes outHoly fuck.

Some sort of bundle with GamePass, tech support, free entry into some events or tournaments they host for a year.  Then once you do this you never shop anywhere else for the next 20 years.\n\nLemme throw a rocket in here too \ud83d\ude80It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.\n\nTLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\n\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\u2702\ufe0f\n\nto all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Yesterday several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon.

Would 100% use this.You know I\u2019m super happy to see GME be THE comeback kid of 2021. Super fun to watch a company go from gutted stores to evolving into an almost interactive online store, which means the tendie printers up top at GME are coming up with some excellent ways to switch it up.\n\nEdit: A thought I had right after. With GameStop\u2019s everywhere in the US, we could see a store with Hopefully decent of parts and can see our product before we buy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever truly bought computer parts from a brick and mortar store, mostly because nothing around me like that racists, a GameStop exsist a thoughSo $CRSR?This actually makes the Microsoft deal make more sense.

I said him being \"CEO\" and he grunted, I think affirmatively \n\n  \nIf you are playing with my heart, you are doing it wellI have not purchased a console since 2014 specifically because pc gaming is far superior with games and graphics. on top of that a great set up can last for 5+ years before you upgrade parts to more modern parts.

Seems like last week's buying was from longs and not short covering just like what some of the research analysts have been saying. \n\nSome large hedge funds probably have done the same on-the-ground research as you have and they agree with the transformation thesis.\n\nMy take is, it will take two quarters to fully digest what the new store transformation will do to SP. But in the meantime it can certainly rally on optimism. \n\n$50 seems possible in the interim with $100 by eoy if transformation is successful by Sep for back to school sale.\n\nI think a great trade is to buy 2022 or 2023 leaps on Tuesday if price is still cheap.I wonder if they could ammend their deal with Microsoft to include kickbacks on PC sales.I can't find a thing about this anywhere. Hopefully some PC media outlets catch this rumor and do the same diligence some commenters have, and then run a story on it.

I\u2019m going to do research in my local area to see if it\u2019s happening near where I live (large metropolitan area).yo who's wet or hard rn bc got damn... Imagine the tendies once GME gets balls deep in e-sports after creating a bunch of pros w/ these 1.5 storesI've been saying this from the very beginning that GME needs to focus more on PC and am glad to hear they're looking that route.  I have the older generation of consoles, but have been almost exclusively playing on PC for the past 5 years.  PC users also tinker with their rigs too by upgrading various components so you should see recurring revenue.  It sounds like a dope idea.They can become Starbucks for gamersWe should blast Ryan Cohen with \u201cideas\u201d along these same lines in hopes he\u2019ll half-confirm them or something so we can share that on Twitter.Maybe the institutional shorts know this. They are trying to short it as much as possible now, and as time goes on, they buy more and more calls at the correct strikes such that if it slingshots up, the calls are executed at a strike that sells all of their shorts at a profit, and reverses their short position into a long position. So basically short the high, cash out the short and go long at the bottom, and rocket it up to a new high.A news write up of this MOONS the stockIf GameStop pivoted to include like gaming cafes in Asia they would make $$$ and make it a subscription model. America does not have mass gaming cafes. They already have the infra for this.LOLThis is so absolutely THE WAY.\n\nI\u2019m going to sell a large put position on Tuesday I think\n\nEdit: autocorrect[removed]Just an aside, your April calls expire on 16 not 19...in case you have it marked in your calendar as such \ud83e\uddad I am with you @ $29 \u270aAlso remember the website is down having a complete overhaul. Or is that just me in \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7?This reminds me of what Radioshack was doing in the years before bankruptcy. Not to shit on GME, but its true.Is this information legit ?Nice post!\n\nBTW this whole concept reminds me a bit about AutoZone... highly recommend this short video about them from CNBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYNlaLt4jicThey need to M&A with Microcenter. That would be huge!The irony of the company doing the shit I told them to do 2 years ago before they fired me.I used to build my own computer. Like 20 years ago. It is really fun.   \n\n\nMy favorite thing was back then (maybe now still, I dunno) you could buy a cheap Intel chip and get a motherboard that allowed for overclocking and you could basically get the incredibly expensive, top of the line Intel CPU performance out of the really chip CPU and save a bundle. Typically, tho, building your own PC was far more expensive than buying something off the shelf unless you found a good cheap place for the parts.\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude80No f-Ing way .  This is way too niche to mane any real $$$.  The PC parts business is super competitiveWhat\u2019s a PC?For people that enjoy paying 6 times markup on low margin partsGuys, the only decent bull case right now is the short squeeze continuing.\n\nNews and performance of the company don't matter if you are buying now, it's purely technical.\n\nIf you wait for that bubble to pop a bit and come in after the dust settles in this thesis, I'm with you on it.\n\nAll this to say GME 420C 01/29/2021.I realize why all the people here call everyone autists.\n\nY'all might make some money on this but how many times the mods gonna tell you this is illegal. It's not worth tanking all of WSB for a payout, especially not from GME....So, basically what you're saying is that their gaming business is dead and they are desperately coming up with ridiculous ideas to save the company.PC gamers would never build their rigs at a GameStop... lmfao, maybe some fortnight kidOrder your fucking parts online and assemble in your basement like a fucking normal person. GameStop looks and smells like Spencers fucking Gifts to me. Or worse, Build-a-Bear. What useless tripe. Retail for idiots.\n\nI suppose that there are a LOT of computer idiots who might think themselves on their way to hacker status if they finally build their own computers...Huge news if true. I'll increase my Put position on Tuesday if they confirm this business strategy. \n\nFirst of all, Gamestop employees are in no way qualified to speak with any confidence about the technical PC parts needed for high-end gaming rigs. \n\nThey are part-time High School kids who weren't even born when Battletoads came out. \n\nBesides, this business model has been tried once before. The company was called RadioShack. They also had Trump Steaks and Sharper Image massagers - and they failed.\n\nBut I guess Gamestop has Funko dolls, so there's that.Right? Microcenter doesn't have anywhere near the spread of GME stores either. My closest microcenter is like an hour away.\n\nI told the manager I would use that service to buy my next gaming PCRC must have othe plans than just convenience microcenters. I am expecting expecting a turn to tech.is a tiny microcenter a nanocenter?  \n\n# \ud83e\udd14Been screaming this and getting yelled at from the non GME people... they could have exclusives too with Corsair or Razr or whoever... huge move if true. Pcpartspicker meets micro centerGME is going to be what you get when you mix Microcenter with Build-A-Bear.  GET HYPE!ThisThere was a fucking line to get in the one by the Hibachi place a couple hours ago. Makes me want to go in and check on my investment.This is the kind of move I can get behind, but knowing how stingy Gamestop is on deals that don't involve used games I'm not holding my breath that they will ultimately be a good place for pc builders to buy their parts, and I have to imagine any prebuilts that would come out from them are going to be pricey as well.You're not getting microcenter storage at tiny strip mall locations :/ \n\nMaybe gamestop will just become newegg but without the scalping and fucking horrible customer service and RMA bullshit when you need a simple return.Thank you!!!!I\u2019ve been preaching they need a steam/epic like app and compete in that market, that\u2019s a huge move though and that would need to have been in the works a while. But if that is the case GME could become a monster of hardware and software gamingMost PC parts are low-margin thoughYes. And remember this is just one small part of their overall re-posturing effortLookup microcenter in the meantime\n\nEdit: ah thought you meant los angelesLegit nerds? Where is your line on nerd? Some fuckhead who can plug a graphics card into a motherboard? If this is anything like Geek Squad, GTFO.Fry's is bankrupt / closing isn't it? I've heard they're finally closing after not restocking inventory for a long time.ehm... have you tried to assemble a PC? It is as difficult as small set of lego for 10-12 year old. I literally build my own PC 5 years ago without prior building experience. Had some trouble connecting pins on the motherboard but all this shit was overall easy. Stop exaggerating, you don't need to be \"passionate\", lolEven a boomer can learn to build their own PC.  It's literally like LEGO's.RadioShack tried this and failed - hard.It's this sort of shit that's on the ground all about customer-business interactions that those homos at Melvin don't do. Just assholes killing a company that wants to give people something they want. We have actually out done them with market research. Unbe-fucking-leivable. I love you guys.now this is DD. actual investigations going onFuck yeah. Yeah I think she probably gave away more than she was supposed to... I'm not gonna cite the specific store because I don't want to get her in trouble. She was very informative and helpfulAlso in October, the deal with MSFT was [announced](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/).\n\nThey\u2019re shifting all their business operations to the Microsoft 365 stack, including CRM Dynamics.  They\u2019ll be setup for better data driven decisions and collaboration.  It also equips all staff with Surface devices on the sales floor.  Maybe something like the Apple store where there\u2019s not really a register anymore.  Just checkout with the employee anywhere.\n\nThis deal also includes a GME cut of all digital sales from Xboxes sold from GME for the life of the console.  That\u2019s some nice extra revenue for essentially little effort.  And this happened in October!  I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ll see how much they made from that deal with nextgen console sales in their next quarterly.Holy shit this just gave me the biggest fucking chills in my life.... if they plan to discuss this to the public fully anytime soon then good luck trying to even get in.Cohen isn\u2019t CEO yet??Have a reward for your effort\ud83d\ude80Holy fuck. \n\nI'm in for $2k on TuesdayA random guy at a GameStop that knows about Cohen? Sounds unlikely.This is fantastic! Thanks for sharingNow this is journalism I can subscribe to.Same! trying to figure out compatibility etc before ordering is a pain in the ASSMakes me wonder if they'll have Geek Squad type employees who will build it for you for a price or if they'll just help you assemble the parts.I can't tell if the posts are made by tards or bots. But count me in on thinking they are dumb either way.I'll bring some if they don't yet!I think they call them marsgaritas.For sure. But the manager seemed convinced they were pushing forward. Go call your local GME stores and see what they say.Given the general sentiment in this post we should probably call RC and make it true\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFuck yeah thanks man! Im a boomer lmaoHoly fucking shit, you are a fucking smoothbrained heroWow, you just changed my life! \ud83d\ude31My old graphics card was so heavy it literally loosened my PCI express slot on my mobo. I really need a new one, so Melvin pay up already.Same, my graphics card is slowly dyingOnly at GME?Maybe board chairman is better> Linus tech tips \n\nOh yeah, their secret shopper episodes were so good but at the same time showed very much, how much potential there is. Especially with those people who don't know how to build a PC and who also don't want to know. And those are a LOT.Do I hear GME dedicated discord server with wsb mods at the forefront?It was definitely pulled for a reason.  You gotta lock up your trash so the bears cant get into it.With your gains, just buy the entire fucking store. \ud83d\ude80Furniture, peripherals... The \ud83c\udf1d's the limit.Sign me up for an RGB headset, keyboard, and mouse. As long as its 15% off if I bought all of it separate, I would go for it.I bought at 19, it went to 21. I bought at 21, it went to 31. Bought at 31, went to 39. Bought at 37, went down to 35. I havent taken a big L this whole time I've been fueling this rocket with you retards and you haven't lead me astray yet. \n\nWe ride this shit the fuck out because when this moons, $5, $10, $20 differences will not matter in the scope of tendies and we will dip them in the blood of Melvin Capital bank coffers!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80My 550 shares are locked and loaded to sell at 420.69. I think there will be a lot of market resistance at that point.Yeah, the shittiest part of assembling a PC rig is that you have to buy MSFT Windows separately (relatively expensive). \n\nI used to pirate windows in the past, but now that I have a respectable income I buy it. MSFT office is expensive as well (and a must for most people).\n\nMaybe this is in part where the microsoft deal comes in with GME?This needs to be at the topEveryone I see is saying buy stocks.stocksAt least 100 shares ... gamble the rest of you want or pick up more shares.Stocks and fucking hold them things.stock and then limit sell at 420.69 so they can\u2019t loan your shares to shortsFrom personal experience, when I build a PC, I go ham and future proof that baby for at least 5 years. I've seen people comparing rigs to phones, but i disagree. It all comes down to if my PC can play the newest fallout, COD, Cyberpunk, etc. on max settings or not.Dude. It's a value play inside a squeeze play. We should be 50 on fundamentals. At least. If news like this was true and got out, shorts are dead. Squeeze soon.Not yet. But we know this sub is HEAVILY monitored and they constantly read what we\u2019re talking about. So if the cats out of the bag wouldn\u2019t you think they\u2019d let the fucking cat out of the fucking bag ASAP? I sure hope so. Especially when they see the hype surrounding it? Make this official Daddy Cohen!AMD and NVDA for sure.Not the best timing for that business model unfortunately.Excuse me?Buy shares.  You would only make the premium on the puts instead of the mad upside of Gme rockets.Are you lost ? Go back to sleepHoly shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*Just checked it here in US. It\u2019s working fine.That was 2015 tough. A lot more people are invested in computers and tech now, we got 40+yr old game streamers now in 2021, so the market has broadened.\n\nI'm just a retard toughInteresting perspective. Is this the final throws, the last gasp of GME? RC isn't your daddy, is he \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bAt $420 a share. I won\u2019t mind paying the premium when I go there to shop in a few months bro.Newegg shoppers need not apply. GME's market will be normies and kids. As it always has been.\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Get fucked. Hope you close that short position ASAP. We\u2019re about to take your milk money and eat your lunch.Honestly it was high quality I might, I'm 37, I have money and I don't have the desire to go through the whole pc part picking experience relearning whats good every 5 years.Imagine being 40 and shitting on people who need a hand buying and putting together their first gaming pc.Your user name does NOT check out. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bYou don\u2019t need a degree to understand the \u201ctechnical computer parts required for high end gaming rigs\u201d it\u2019s not a fucking nuclear reactor.Get fucked \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bBro who is huge into pc gaming told me same thing - getting High end gaming pc stuff is either online or driving hours to micro center. Having a gme around the block would be game changer for him and others like himI live in Florida and hate how we have nothing close to microcenters here.Just checked and my closest Microcenter is 8 hours away. About the same for Fry\u2019s.\n\nI have 10 GME stores within a 1 hour drive.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I legit didn't even know about microcenter until GME started getting comparisons. Known about Gamestop my whole life. \ud83d\ude80My closest microcenter is over 12 hour driveI bet these pc-building stores are what they planned to talk about at the conference when they switched from retail to tech. \n\nBut for whatever reason they weren\u2019t ready to announce that just yet so they canceled.When can I expect a GME electric vehicle?Other plans you say? When can I expect the rollout of a GME electric vehicle?I'd like a kiosk to build a mouse. Left side panels for buttons, shell configurations for different hand sizes and weights, different plastic slider thingy shapes and sizes, different cords.As long as every component can be RGB, I'm in![deleted]This is true; but additional services (think Best Buy\u2019s Geek Squad for example, or GamePass) are basically pure profit.\n\nSame with accessories, mouse pads, mice, software, fancy lighting. Anything outside of core components.Loss leader but without the loss partno branded micro centers near me if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, and the run down mom and pop shops are not where karen will take georgiepoo to build his $2,000 systemyeah los angeleshttps://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/kyrmto/associates_assembling_pc_for_customer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfknowing all your funko pops and knowing how to properly install any brand of component without shorting or destroying pins are very different level of nerds\n\nedit: and do it without googling it in front of the customerMy line for nerds is if you got bullied in highschool or notLmao thinking pc building is just plugging GPU on a moboI think it's more on the lines of having an intuitive knowledge of compatibility without needing to Google - once the parts are confirmed to work together it's a piece of cakeAh yes but here we are forced to examine the difference in \u201ccan\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d \n\nExample/ How many cats out there changing their own oil? They all *could* they just *dont*LEGO's are for nerds. I figured that out because I'm crushing on one. Who knew nerds could be so hot?You understand the stock price doesn't actually impact the companies results right? The price going up or down does NOT create more or less revenue. It may make it harder for them to issue more shares to raise funds but debt is super cheap right now if they were to need money to grow.\n\n The companies results normally impact the stock price but not always.  It is a loose correlation driven by INVESTORS sentiment and macro events. The economy could tank dragging down the stock price and GME could actually have great sales and their stock could trade flat. It also depends on how other companies are doing.  Gme as an investment is competing with other companies for investor dollars based on return vs risk.added his comment to my OPWe should call more gamestops and see what we can gather. I think Cohen is going to announced as CEO soon.Sometimes I give info to customers who seem \"legit\" the unspoken rule is don't rat put the person who gave you info. I've witnessed firsthand people getting fired over something like this.This confirms the transformation is happening. On-the-ground DD matches your news. I'm convinced. Buying leaps Tuesday open. This will moon within a year for sure.Might also be related to a potential analytics/advertising platform. Found some rumors on twitter.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LbVQgNqNope, just now only has a board seat as of MondayNo, and we don't want him to be. We want him to run for board chairman in June (which should be an uncontested run if he owns 19.9%). CEO answers to the board, but the board chairman answers to no one.Thanks man.I still have fans that were \"supposed\" to be compatible with my build so this is definitely the move for GMEIn my head I see this as a kiosk order that is sent to, say, a regional assembly hub. From there it ships complete either to the store or to your door. Associates in store would be there for advice on component choices, accessories, and upsells such as subscriptions or protection services. \n\nPerhaps the best part of the kiosk is the potential to build in performance estimates and benchmarks for a particular build as you put it together. Estimate graphics settings and framerates and shit like that. The store employee can know almost jack shit about PCs because the kiosk does it for you. Jusy need one guy at corporate that stays on top of it and pushes out updates.\n\nIf it were my business, assembly would be built into the price at the kiosk.Are we sure Cohen is on board with this strategy if it began before he was on the BoD?  I can't see why he wouldn't think it's a great move, but it seems like this is the perfect thing to announce at the conference, and they pulled out.Was about to cal three of the local gamestops but they closed 45 mins ago. On the other hand, theyALL have 4.5+ stars and 200+ reviews, lol.YO RC IS THIS POST TRUE?I hope you don\u2019t get a 3090 then, that shit is a tankMy laptop wants to light on fire when i open chrome soooo.I did a small double take there on your joke. If you live near bears, they really do go through the trash. Kinda like cats. \ud83e\udd2dThis is an underappreciated commentTasty$100 by 2022 is too low for you? You should work for GS!\n\nGeez the hate is real. Okay then, I'm upgrading to $100 by eom Jan. Good enough? No? Wow..okay $100 by eow.Selling puts = bullishHaha no. I\u2019m up big and getting moreMaybe I\u2019m retarded. I think they\u2019ve just left the U.K. for good. \ud83d\ude2d Can\u2019t even shop online now. Oh well, maybe if this squeeze happens I can profit to reopen a U.K. store.\n\nLiterally a week ago it went down so I thought, oh shit, it\u2019s Ryan Cohen.But isn't console gaming *MUCH* bigger in America?\n\nIs it because Americans generally don't care for PC-gaming or that it is not advertised enough?Not a degree, just some expertise - which the average Gamestop employee doesn't have. \n\n\n\"Which one of these graphics cards is best for that new Cyberpunk game, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or the AMD Radeon RX 5700?\"  \n\n\n\"Ummm....I dunno. Wanna buy some Pokemon cards?\"First person experience here. It took me 2 months to get all the parts in my budget. Gamestop is very well positioned if they decide to get into the trade. Also PC building is an addictive hobby. You start as a gamer trying to save some bucks and end up pimping your case. Head over to r/buildapc and r/sffpc to see what kind of community. It would really be a game changer for Gamestop.Not if they don't stock anything though.  I guess I'm not seeing the appeal of walking into a brick and mortar store down the street to use a kiosk to place and order for a part or system that will be shipped to my house.  Isn't that what a website is from home?\n\nNot trying to shit on GME here, I'm literally all in, but them getting rid of toys and candy and shit, and replacing it all with stocked PC parts you can take home that day sounds more appealing to me.As someone that has build a couple computers before (nothing huge but I know the basics) I can assure you that this market is prime for disruption. Pc building isnt that bad actually but most people dont want to get into it and therefore order a pre build computer online. The problem is that there are hundreds of sites and its very confusing for people to decide which specs to pick. Because of this you have a 90% chance to get ripped off. I seriously believe gamestop could be a mini microcenter but not only for pc builders, but for regular gamers too. \nThey could even combine this with their own digital store, like steam/epic games. You can buy digital games, order pc/console accesories, read gameinformer to stay up to date, have special deals for powerup members and buy digital DLCs or order fysical collectibles from games you play a lot. ALL IN ONE APPLICATION. \nI am just thinking out loud here but everytime I read something like this my dick gets hard and my brain is going sicko mode. Sorry for this long, probably stupid comment but im about to increase my buy order for tuesday \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80As long as it\u2019s priced right cause BestBuy and Walmart have a small selection of high tier pc components but they have insane markups that makes it not worth it.Can second this. I have to drive 4 hours to and from of I want to buy something that day. Fucking sucks.I've been fortunate enough that microcenter is only 10 minutes away but I agree, gme being a microcenter for those people who aren't near one would be great. Better yet, maybe Cohen should talk the board into acquiring microcenterYour bro is spot on. I truly miss having a Micro Center and a Fry's Electronics within 50 miles of each other was glorious. They'd price match each other, but MC 95% was the lowest price, but was instantly sold out. Roll to Fry's and buy.\n\nGot my $1.5K monitor for $799 doing just that. \n\nIf another company filled in for the rest of the country they could steal a lot of online business.My nearest microcenter is over 4600 miles away. I live in the USA. I can find a gamestop much easier.Roadmap was likely to change significantly with RC and the new board, so why present information that is already potentially outdated?Would be a game changer to be able to try it out in personWhat do you mean? Like all the DD that has been posted or just this post?This post is pretty well formulated broFancy lighting? Does this mean my new GME rig will be yeet enough to to post to R/battlestations?lmao they are NOT happyexactly, & if you\u2019re paying someone to assemble something you don\u2019t want them saying \u201cuh hang on let me see how you install this.\u201d They need to have that in the noggin.That's not a good comparison i feel.  Changing your oil is a lot different as opposed to building a computer that will give you endless hours of entertainment, plus porn.Companies value is set by share price. Getting shorted to oblivion limits options for credit and other avenues for raising funds in hard times. A very healthy company can be run out of business through shorts especially when something like COVID happens. If GME didn\u2019t have a healthy war chest in March there is a good chance they would be gone today. A company that has been on the decline for about 6 years (revenue) and whose stock is a penny stock. They would have to issue hundreds of millions of shares to raise real money and who\u2019s going to buy them? If anything would cause a sell off. What bank would loan them money? \n\nWhile shorts don\u2019t effect day to day operations it does make bankruptcy more likely.Yes, If the STAKEholders equal the SHAREholders. Just cause Melvin has a share, doesn't mean they have a stake in the company. The future for GME under Cohen is so bright, I gotta put on some shades \ud83d\ude0eCohen has big balls, we know that. He has the power to fuck the shorts and begin the mass genocide of shorts, but will he actually use his power you think? Like are there any ramifications with big banks and financial institutions. If he screws them, will anything come back to haunt him/ any relationships that could be broken or severed?If you do this make a DD with all the information consolidated, a little extra to fuel for the rocket never hurtsShould call and say something like \u201chey so I heard the GameStop in San Diego is going to have PC build stations  by July and I was curious if the one near me in (enter city here) is doing the same?\u201d \n\nI say July because I\u2019m assuming it won\u2019t be that quick and if the sales person knows the real timeline then they may slip up and say something like \u201cthat\u2019s odd, I was only aware that stores will have stations by September\u201dOP add this as an edit on your post. We need this to gain traction and hopefully news networks pick up the \u201crumors\u201d. We need a major catalyst to finish the shorts once in for all and start the squeeze. All of this information needs to spread like wildfire.Board Chairman answers to WSB.I like that idea a lot.  I know building a PC can be daunting for people who aren't very DIY, but this would satisfy them and also be a great place to learn more about the different build components.  I definitely think they'd have to have a regional distribution center because their stores are way too small to physically hold all that inventory.  But if you can offer a gaming PC that's built and either delivered to your door or you pick it up at your local GME store in a short time frame, I think they have a winner. \n\nI went through Cyberpower PC on my latest rig and it took about 5 weeks from order to receiving my gaming PC.  If they can beat that time window they can absolutely start taking market share away from those other companies who build PCs.Maybe, he want to get in first and fulfill his share requirement before this moons.Tweet if it\u2019s true!!Yup they've destroyed mine once or twice !In this bubble? Yeah those aren't great returns.Double negative confuses retards.New product, new training.Plus imagine the used parts market they could offer. Most PC gamers cycle through upgrades before they do a full rebuildIf gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80If gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80Think about someone building their first PC, they are going to be very nervous considering the amount of money being spent and without a friend they trust they may just not do it or make critics mistakes that drive them back to consoles. A pc building kiosk with a employee that actual knows pc parts and can help someone setup a pc that does what they need it to do in their price range is huge.The toys/collectible business is huge for them though, so I wouldn't say they should get rid of that.  Dunno about candy though (cheap but high margin, not sure if worth the shelf space?)If gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as \"never out of stock\" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.\n\nAdd third party exclusive partnership like limitedrungames.com and a bonus sub for twitch each month and they go head to head with amazon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 My GME fanfic \ud83d\ude80My dick got so hard it got stuck in a pumpkinWhere do you live, fucking Alaska?Sure I\u2019m speaking more to the idea that just cause you can doesn\u2019t mean you do. \nIn short- Connivence is a real part of what/how/why we do thingsStock price on affects their ability to raise money, not day to day operations.I am long.  I have 4200 shares i wrote covered calls on so I do hope it dips next week before it goes to the moon just under $30, I will pay my dumb tax and then back over $40.\n\nI also have about 40 April 15 $15C.He can't do it by directly commenting on company value, but he can definitely do it by rolling out roadmaps and company visions for upcoming service and operating model changes, which I expect to start to popping up in coming weeks.You can just straight up say  I am interested in building my pc at GameStop, do you guys have parts available? Ask if they are 1.0 or 1.5 store if you feel ballsyYeah imagine if he releases another filing on Tuesday showing that he bought the dip on Friday. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf14To be fair my Tim Apple phone spazzed out and typed something un-intelligible.i'd totally sell them my old pc to build a new one every 2 yrsThat's a really good point actually, if they become a reliable source for used pc parts they will change the gameNo, they wouldn't get rid of the knick knacks. Think about it. Some dad's going there specifically to grab parts for his new  gaming build. For that kid, without anything shiny, It might as well be a doctor's visit. Except more boring because he won't even get that visceral thrill of a needle in his vein or the subsequent joy of a lolli pop.\n\nWell at game stop we have life sized pikachus staring down at the dad while he jacks off to the newest i12 processor. The kids distracted by the life sized pikachu's embrace and coos.\n\nSo while the kids blocking it out, dad inseminated the second generation semi organic computer with his genetic code. \n\nA dead, souless eyed wage slave boxes up the inseminated computer. It incubates during the ride home. Assembles itself. The things ready right out of the box, just wipe off its amniotic fluid.\n\nAnd then you insert the Pikachu into the port. The cooing becomes moans. It gets real X rated real quick. Dad uses the opportunity to explain the birds and the bees to little screwy. \n\nWhile screwy's crying for his lost toy, it's growing into his new best friend. And dad's half son.\n\nI say this as a win, win, win. And a bonus too.\n\nKid gets to learn about reproduction in a sterile yet immersive environment. And loss.\n\nDad gets a new computer and has a lot of fun building it.\n\nKid has a new, semi self assembled computer roughly one generation behind his father's.\n\nAnd the pika-computer is sentient enough to love the kid.\n\nBrb, gonna crowdfund  this blockbuster feel good film of the year.\n\n\nEDIT: finished story is on my page, I couldn't link no sleep here. And it might only be chapter one.... LolololololHawaii or Guam for sure.Yes, fucking AlaskaSure, if they don't want to build their own PC.  They can just buy a console, the option will be there.\n\nAll i'm saying is, you are really underestimating the value in empowering retail buyers to be able to build their own desktop at a store in person.  The convenience is there.Good luck fellow autist \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4cAnd by exercising his option to buy more sharesI'm really unrealistically hoping he would drop something like this on Monday to drive pressure on Tuesday. This is a wet dream though and I'm retarded.That\u2019s actually what I believe is the most realistic. Look for a form4 filing.Lol can't wait until gamestop offers me $2 for it like my used games> if they become a reliable source for used pc parts they will change the game\n\ngosh that would be so nice, and to be able to like inspect it in store as well, have had issues with used/refurbished parts being complete duds and having go through the whole tedious replace/return is awfulFucking lol, what the fuck did I just read.Oh oh yeah; totally. \nIt\u2019s a great idea. \nI think there\u2019s a market for sure.Drop it tuesday morning @9:30.

We understand that hard work isn't the key to success, marketing yourself and your product is.\n\nIt was a lot easier to get ahead in a world that had less rules and regulations.\n\nMusk is in a tech that the competition is trying to catch, much like smaller software companies that completed with Gates. Alex is doing the same thing in his field. Mark. Z. The examples are countless.\n\nWill competition pop up? sure. But I'll ride the train up as long as possible in the mean time.\n\nMusk may have fun, but hey he's a richer guy than you or me: so he did something right. He called his own company put plenty of times, and I think that also helped fuel his success. Boomers taught younger generations to \"always tell the truth\" which was bullshit and why they hate them, but for those rare people who always speak it they become a type of god in their eyes.\n\nOr it's all bullshit and we are living in the worst simulation ever.He\u2019s laser focused because of the pot.Elon Musk is insanely laser focused.  He sleeps on the floor of SpaceX.  He smoked pot once because the god of podcasting pushed it on him and he's too much of a bad ass to say no.. didn't even look like he inhaled.  Sure he's got a ton of other things in the fire like Tesla, Boring, Solar Roofs, etc. but he's doing insanely well there too.  \n\nMusk is King.But his wife is Canadian?yet MS products sucks and tesla makes far superior products.He started a rocket company and a car company. Two of the hardest industries to break in to. Meanwhile Gates built DOS and basic when the soil was fertile for such innovation. \n\nElon definitely worked hard to get where he is, if you think otherwise you\u2019re a fool.Bro your literally a boomer. Sorry.FUCK[I'm gonna be honest](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/956/Joe_Rogan_Experience__1255_-_Alex_Jones_Returns!_3-24-49_screenshot.png)He's pushing on the certain brakes.

This aint fuckin doordash\n\nThis is very true - and I  totally agree. If doordash is worth THAT, then Palantir is worth at least 40.Yes, but the point still stands: Boomers are learning they can't deny the power of memes.But chasing 100 baggers will make you rich!I'm bullish, its why I raised it to 32$ this week, last 3 weeks have been for 30$.Or jerking off homeless guys for a cheeseburgerRemind me!  14 monthsMemes aside, do I buy some of this horse shit?I tried to short the high on GME USING FDs. That was a miserable experience. My entry was perfect but it bounced back to my entry price and they were down $2000.  They\u2019re so unpredictable lolI agree man but I still need enough time for them to print. Don\u2019t wanna give all my tendies to r/thetagang. \n\nMy options usually expire worthless and the stock moons the day after.When I first joined this sub (2 months), I didn\u2019t know these types of comments were jokes. Can we start putting /s on this type of stuff.Here in Europe we can\u2019t access ARKK or ARKW or ARKanything- should I just buy some of these stocks as they\u2019re all cool and futuristic, which means they\u2019ll always go to the moonTO THE HOOHObviously not :)\n\nIn other words\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80Yes it is>\tIt was a lot easier to get ahead in a world that had less rules and regulations\n\nlmao. right, it\u2019s just that musk has taken billions of taxpayer money to support his companies.There is one man in common amongst the 3 modern names you dropped, and he literally wrote the book on the strategy you\u2019re describing. Do you know who he is?No doubt he's made a lot of things right. I believe he's the prime example of the right person, at the right place at the right time.  Had he tried to popularise EVs a few years earlier (like many other did), he would be almost guaranteed to fail. Same with SpaceX.  There's a saying that luck is the meeting between an opportunity and someone prepared for it. \n\nRegarding the whole iconoclastic cult-figure market technique, its a remarkable feature of our times and fortunately one that I believe is nearing its end. Prior to him was Jobs and prior to that, Gates (which was also a controversial figure back in the 90s).>We understand that hard work isn't the key to success, marketing yourself and your product is.\n\nIf you ask TSLA bros, hes revolutionizing the entire industry.He moved HQ to Denver, where shrooms are now decriminalized.Even though no one can make a diagnosis based on someone's public figure alone, it's fair to say there's a high probability he does meet the criteria for Bipolar disorder and/or ADHD. \n\nIf that's the case, he probably does have periods of hyper focus, but they're probably mixed with lots of periods of very low focus and a very high optimism and very low frustration threshold.  These things have certainly contributed to his success, coupled with the necessary intellect and resources.  \n\nNow that maybe a winning combination now, but it's certainly a liability on the long run, as he may eventually jeopardize the company by pushing ahead less productive ideas.His wife agreed to name their kid a bunch of nonsense. You think she cares about the hooker?Guess I'm too autistic to understand comparing software to cars and batteries.What\u2019s funny is that Gates bought his first operating system and marketed it better than the guy who invented it, and these kids have no idea.\n\nGo watch Pirates of Silicon Valley y\u2019all.Clench so hard you barf?I think Elon's antagonism is a strength. When Tesla first started reputable car mag's were purposely draining the battery and giving Tesla false reviews. Although Tesla vehicles did have some issues not sure if that is the case going forward.Show me one instance where I said he didn't work hard? A lot of people work very hard in this world, probably harder than both Gates and Musk. Hard work is definitely a prerequisite for this kind of success, but definitely not the only one.Look it up lol he didn't start Tesla. He became a major funder 2 years after it startedI was in 500\u20ac and felt every bump. I guess I'm turning, because I pumped a little more in at every dip totaling now 3.5k\u20ac and I dont feel anything anymore.

Over the last four (4) quarters, the Client conducted trades in financial instruments in significant size at an average frequency of ten (10) per quarter.\n\nTo determine the significant size IBUK considers the following:\n\na. During the last four quarters, there were at least forty (40) trades; and\nb. During each of the last four (4) quarters, there was at least one (1) trade; and\nc. The total notional value of the top forty (40) trades of the last four (4) quarters is greater than EUR 200,000; and\nd.

I dont suppose to know more about space travel than he does,  but I've seen interviews with astronomers arguing that we're on the brink of over saturating earth's orbit with debris. That could lead to a chain reaction where a single colision would generate thousands of smaller debris and thus far, other colision. In this scenario, theory goes, space travel would become impossible, as we would be trapped on earth.  \n\nIn light of that, he would be sabotaging his dream with his satellite constellation. \n\nPS: there might be some technical details regarding his satellites orbit height, but if I remember it correctly,  it's not consensual whether those orbits would make it safe.Did you forget he called a freaking thai rescue diver a pedo?

Can you explain would you would call a child a hooker? If he is a pedo, he would be raping children, not buying hookers. Makes me think you're the one projecting.

I feel like this is really obvious information but my retarded ass wasn\u2019t paying attention.You can interpret my legitimate question to trolling all you want. I'm going to stand by the fact that you associated being a pedo with Thai Hookers, when children are not hookers, they are kidnapped. That's what you've left behind. Typically when I call these things out, people delete their posts. I hope you don't so we can get a history of what you've said. Maybe that will help you be more careful about your accusations.Chill man. I'm not the one making actual public accusations about people being paedophiles. This is a fucking subreddit where people call themselves autists and retards and make jokes about their wifes boyfriends.

Judging by her picture, I doubt this girl has many interactions with men in general.He runs a fortune 500 company. He literally controls over a BN in annual revenue and has like 37k employees who depend on his company to feed their families. And he spends his free time shitposting with some random guy pretending to be the planet mars on twitter. \n\nIts uplifting because this proves any autist off the street can achieve great success in america. Then it's also very very very concerning that people like me are running things. ahem.. elon chanReminder that this man's space company built a more powerful rocket than NASA in 1/3 of the time with 10% of the budget. Elon\u2019s gonna land on mars first just so he can stick his dick in itSince SpaceX isn't public you can't invest in it. Luckily Alphabet (Google's parent company) has a 7.5% cut in SpaceX, so you could invest in that if you think you're gonna get like 40,000% return, which if Elon Chan makes it to Mars is quite possible in my humble opinion.I thought girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider, no? The only two things Elon does in the world is work and shitpost. Amazing[deleted]Long $TSLA\n\nIf it jumpes imma put my life savings into it (3$)What a national fucking treasure.\n\n\n\nSomeone send him Mars Chan hentai. This is unironically bullish. All in TESLA. All aboard the Elon train...er...rocketship[deleted]srsly elonI always check and it\u2019s always realWhy is this Lainey person involved Elon saw big bro Bezos doing it and wanted some of that fun.Slight tangent but why do ugly women say how much they hate men? Men probably avoid them like the plague so how the fuck would they even know they hate them?\n\nIt's always the ugly onesimagine being rejected by a large rock floating in space.. ouch@laineyjanelle I guess you haven\u2019t read the book \u201cMen are from Mars and women are from Venus\u201d \ud83d\ude01Does Elon Musk just sit at his PC all day typing his name into Twitter?Show me you\u2019re wet.Wait, but don't boys go to Mars to get more candy bars?This is the proof that we're in a simulation, and the admins has fucked the timelines.Ah, the feminist.But... 'Men are from mars'This is the one of tbe most unexpected tweets ever from someone with space money\n\nI guess that's why every memer likes elonHere is what you will need for a elonmusk-fact-checker-bot I think \n\n- Python\n- Python reddit api wrapper PRAW (respond to mentions, to download image, and reply)\n- Image transcription library like pytessaract (to transcribe the image content)\n- extract the tweet\n- twitter api access using something like python-twitter (to search and confirm the tweet, copy URL)\n- upon confirmation reply the URL using PRAW\n- host the bot in cloud, vps, or in a local host and set up a  cronjob.Every comment is the same from the last is this a real Elon tweet. Even the same order wtfAnd once again I can eat dinner tonight thanks to Elon shitpostingDamn I was hoping for actual newsFThe pics would be cold... real cold. Musk is Mars\u2019 bae. This screencap doesnt even have the part where he joked about no nut november in it either lmaoMusk is asking for dick pics now??Uranus wants Elon even moreElon Musk is the player character in our simulation. *send me pics of how wet you areImage is missing the larger version of Mars replying \u201cWhen are you coming over babe?\u201d, seen below\nElon\u2019s last reply. Wait... Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus?But men are from Mars. TSLA cut deliveries workforce :(Missed a blatant parking his rocket joke.Ahh, love, No?Is this real life?Doesn't she mean \"Venus\"?

I think Elon\u2019s talking about the sunThank god it\u2019s not November Mars is hot AND gassy, hope ya still love her right Elon!Holy fuck I love it.Short $TUG, Long $TSLA. Got it.I'm pretty sure men aren't going anywhere near that chick for her to be so upset about their existence here. As for Elon and Mars.......that's just a godamn love story if I've ever seen one.So we just going to ignore the fact that likw half the us population thinks what she Said isn't sexist? What a time to be alive.\nI am glad to live in this generation.Amazing. Every time I think he can't be any cooler he does shit like this.Pretty sure she doesn't have to worry about any men wanting to be with her either.Now, how low will $TSLA go Cringey douche This so fucking cringy at not funny at allIncels, celebrity worship, and late stage capitalism combineElon Musk is a conservative, cuz he's rich.I miss the old ElonElon Musk is a pedophilethere's an inverse relationship between # of elon tweets and the stock price\n\nMore shit posts = Lower TSLA$ priceVery wrong indeed lol. The posts continue when mars sends a pic of a nipple. It was before 5pm in California when he was tweeting these.Or can you? Does r/beetlejuicing still exist?Because it's basically Donald Trump tweets, but he does it for reddit memes unironically. Holy Ghost Looks like the man hater deleted here account? *yoikes*Did he actually just say \u201eKinda does make me wanna nut\u201c?? Well that was one hell of a rabbit hole.\n\n10/10 would recommend.\nhow does this nigga have time, like for real...did he clone himself??It's real And it goes onYou really don\u2019t know that Elon is a shit poster on the level of your average autistic NEET yet? Dude still thinks quoting Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the peak of comedy. The only thing not real is the girl\u2019s implication that men bother herLong $TSLAStrangest timeline ITS NOT?Mod this autist! Wait...BASED ElonEven if it's fake, why would you remove it? It's a funny meme then....Very real sir I appreciate your honesty I'm glad you've learned your lesson.The mods here are even more autistic than the regular folks [He did](https://twitter.com/4thFromOurStar/status/1094026428264341504)He said \"hot pics\". Not nudes.My fiance is sitting here confused as to why that woman would want to go to Mars at all... For this reason. HahahahaI'm sure she is thrilled with the harassment she no doubt has received after all this. Her Twitter has been deleted. I feel bad for her. She was probably just trying to vent about something stupid and this happened. [deleted]Yeah but he still gotta take a shit man, these are prob toliet tweetsWhat are you gonna do, just lose your sense of humor once you get successful? If anything he\u2019s so rich he\u2019s stopped giving afHe\u2019s also in the [list of 400 people](https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/#57bdfcf47e2f ) who own more than over 150,000,000 Americans Yeah 60 years later tho. If NASA still had any kind of budget they'd still be pushing the envelope \"Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit than Falcon Heavy.\"\nhttps://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy\n\nIts been 50 years since NASA started development of Saturn V. I'd attribute any cost reduction to advancements in information technology, as well as not having to reinvent the wheel. Unless you are talking about a different rocket.Yeah but Elon can use pre-existing technology as a basis for his rockets. NASA had to do R&D on every single system and aspect nearly from scratchFirst man to cum on MarsAlphabet isn't Google's parent company, it's literally Google with the name changed.Sure is buddy, just going with the what news is going around, even more so coz it's bezosI'm so sorry you're so miserable and insecure that you feel the need to say such awful things about people. I'm genuinely sorry. I hope you find some happiness. She made the original tweet. She has now deleted herself from Twitter because of all the harassment she received. People like you are the reason. If you treat someone poorly for how they look, they tend to not like you. Men are from Mars, women are from Venus.  This is common Sci fi knowledge boisLooks like someone won't be going to mars.He's technically the oldest he's ever been at this exact moment.  I'm fond of this old Elon.banI mean, it's possible he was projecting but I kinda want to see evidence first.This is the exact opposite of what happens, lolIn-depth research shows TSLA performance is positively correlated to the frequency of Elon shitposts. \n\nIf you think he\u2019s shitposting a lot now, you really should check the week of Oct 24, 2018, or from late 2012 to mid 2013.\n\nAnd Elon jacks off to it. [No I'm not kidding.](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1094027558235058182)Actually, I think he may have been in Europe when he texted this.  Close to Amsterdam.Gads.Well, I can'tHello VsauceMusk 2020If even 0.01% of Elon's followers decided to harass her, that would be almost 2,500 people.  Not a huge surprise.[deleted]in a weird wayIt isn't?you all have seen his old pictures right?  This shouldn't be any surpriseI'm sorry but Monty Python friggin sucks.

It's clear you idiots are too maladjusted to moderate yourselves in any fashion. Lol he got a fucking planet nippleAre there hotter pics than nude ones?Lesson learned: don\u2019t say 50% of the population shouldn\u2019t exist. They had us in the first half not gonna lie>People like me\n\nI mean autistic shitposters who frequently get into nonsense internet arguments with strangers. Why? I've accomplished more than Elon as wellDont forget control about where to spend the money.> If NASA still had any kind of budget\n\nNASA has been reciving 65% of Apollo era funding since 1973.\nThey just spend this on buying stuff like 200mil$/unit 1970s rocket engines Not at the same speed though. It being part of the government means that progress is slowed by all the red tape.Could be talking about the still ongoing development of SLS which is over-budget and over-schedule. Don't know the exact numbers, though. SLS is much more comparable to Starship, tho, and that thing is not done yet.\n\nEDIT: There was also the Ares rocket that was cancelled once it became obvious that private launch providers would be more efficient in orbital launches than NASA.I was talking about the BFR or whatever he calls it vs the rocket NASA has been building for a decade called Orion. They are allocated billions every year for it's development and every year it seems to be 4 years away from completion. We need another war if we want NASA to be innovative or else space you be left to the private industry. I'm not sure, but I was under the impression that we don't actually have good records of how the Saturn V was built, so they may actually have been re-engineering the wheel.\n\nThis isn't really to argue with your point, just what I thought. Yeah and those guys did it with pen and paper like literally doing all calculations by hand. Not anymore they are in unknown land with BFR for the most of the systemsNASA helped Hollywood not the space industry. [deleted]Yes and no. Basically Alphabet became corporate owner of Google, but also took on Google's subsidiaries (Wayno, Deepmind etc), making google the company souly google stuff. I hope that made sense, it's kinda confusing.Twitter truly is a sick and toxic place that brings out the worst in everyone. > Boys go to Mars to get more candy bars.\n>\n> Girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider.\n\nThus spake Zarathustra. And it was known.Billionaires publicly sexting with planetary objects. This is truly the dankest timelines.Wait so how many of those crazy ass Elon tweets that pop up all over reddit are real? I genuinely thought all of them plus this would be photoshoppedJesus ChristThis is the kind of DD I'm looking for. That's it, I'm all in on TSLA. God bless Elon. Truly we live in the best timeline I was born in the upmost perferct generation I cannot thank my parents or the universe enough this is a beautiful time to be alive [321 blast off](https://twitter.com/ZainRaz4/status/1094028067981443072?s=20) Wtf it's like Trump, I hear these ridiculous things and think it's a joke, but it's real I don't even know what's real anymoreThe legend.ok what the fuckI would play DnD with Elon. I wouldn't, let him DM, mind you.I don't know how i feel about this timeline anymore[deleted]Holy shit I can\u2019t believe this isn\u2019t fake! What else hasn\u2019t been fake?Not gonna lie. That's pretty awesome. Elon is turning into John McAffee. Dude is straight up crazy and I love it.Hey, at least he's not presidentAt least he's not calling anyone a pedo, I guess. Ok so we can blame this one on the ambien According to Americans anywhere in Europe is close to Amsterdam.Good enough for me. Who says noHe\u2019s been flying like a son of a bitch lately. It\u2019s technically work but he\u2019s got some time to tweetMore like 420 hours a week... am I right? Am I left??He\u2019s been asked about this actually. He says he tweets primarily during \u201cinterstitial periods\u201d like taking a taking a dump. Literally shitposting.He doesn't actually tweet that much. Until everybody climaxes. YESSITTISSBring forth the Holy Hand Grenade!First of all, how dare you? Fawlty Towers is the GOAT thoI thought the same thing until I watched it high. Never laughed so hard. But, that is what it took. \n\nI can only imagine how funny Dr. Who is while high. ...added to to-do list. Cancel this. Dr. Who is already slightly funny so, no. \n\nTheory is that it has to be British comedy and really stupid while normal, then it will be great while high.I love that I have now received more downvotes for my monty python bashing than Iver ever gotten for upvotes Thank you wsb you prove me right every day bitches!Gay bowser.\u201cThank goodness it\u2019s not november\u201d Jesus Christ Muskie, or should I say \u201cElon Musk Muskie\u201d cause this man is my new god.Keep up the good work champ This sub doesn\u2019t deserve you What you mean fake tweets aren\u2019t the pinnacle of humor?Yaaa I am pretty fuckin stupidPetition to remove you as mod. You're the one who's stupid. Literally the shauncore guy said a couple days ago that a middle ground between shit posts and DD is most desirable. If this post were false, it would be a very funny shit posts and definitely not worth removing. Calling me an idiot and maladjusted to moderate myself is completely uncalled for. Being a mod for an online forum has really gotten to your head.ThermostatCalifornia wildfire damage to PCG put holders?Pam's art[deleted]Unless your Bill Gates I really doubt that Compared to how we used to spend money it gets less https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA#/media/File:NASA-Budget-Federal.svg and I think the budget suffers from lack of focus becuase of not having specific goals to work towards like we did in the space raceThe government can also dump resources into research exploration knowing it's good for society long term without having to worry about quarterly reportsIs that the thing that got blown over during a storm?Sort of. Each Saturn V ended up being unique, and the supply chain was so complex that once they were no longer produced it would require revisiting R&D in order to replicate. We have the plans, it's just that the plans would require us to establish tens of billions in infrastructure, and wouldn't be exact to any Saturn V that had ever flown. Additionally many of the original manufacturers for parts are dead or out of business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the thread OP was referring to either Orion or SLS compared to Falcon Heavy, not Saturn V. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: TypoYou\u2019re an idiot *insideGrab them by the Pluto.2018 was pretty crazy.

It's a great cult..ure...great Elon will make me a millionaire one day. Kinda makes me wanna \ud83e\udd5c tbhEh, it was better 30-40 years ago when we only had Vietnam, nuclear war and the population bomb to worry abouti mean, it's all a joke.  Elon has a sense of humor.It\u2019s only tweets related to the company that need to be censoredNot yet.No, he actually was going to Amsterdam you dumbass, read the news.  I'm American but I know geography.  You must be European cuz you're an arrogant snob![this man fucks](https://i.imgur.com/c8CSex0.jpg)Your constitution, hes Born in africa[deleted]And the fanbois chuckle.That doesn't say much if you have to be high to laugh at it though!

There's a reason their empire collapsed.You're just not old enough to get it yet.Almost ElongatedThis sub doesn't pay youIf you want cringy memes and fake tweets made by 13 year olds, there are other subs for thatAllowing screenshots of tweets with no relation to trading, in a trading subreddit, is itself a compromise. Do you not realize this is /r/wallstreetbets  and not /r/memes? omegalulThe above post is idiotic and maladjusted. Gotta say that I agree with you. There's been a recent shift in this sub for the worse, which most people are blaming on the subreddit expanding, but I think it's really caused by shitty mods power tripping.Oh baby. Show me your water pump gasket. That\u2019s why I love people like Kanye, Trump, and Elon regardless of if I believe in their ideas. I love that no matter how much wealth, power, and influence they have, they\u2019re still true to themselves.You say that sarcastically but it *is weird*. It\u2019s very unusual. Many celebrities do not usually even tweet themselves and if they do, their profiles are usually professional/promotional. Billionaires (or really anyone who is accountable to shareholders) even more so. \n\nI get that his public persona probably helps Tesla as a brand/stock but he can keep that persona without shitposts. Elon will argue with people with 0 followers who @mention him. He clearly finds it fun and doesn\u2019t give a fuck about potential consequences.But I do crossfit so technically I'm a Chad and musk is a virgin\n\nBill Gates by comparison is such a dweeb he shoots ovum while jacking offTake a look at absolute amount you have a table just on the page you linkedYeah, but it's they don't really sorry we about doing stuff quickly unless they're in a war.No, the thing that got blown over is like a dummy shell/mass-drag simulant to test autonomous landing and Raptor engine thrust profile for the Starship. The test hopper is called Starhopper; it's like rapid prototyping. The SLS is NASAs interplanetary/super-heavy launch vehicle that's been in development for about 10 years.Gotcha, that makes sense. How can you land on the moon when it's obviously a flat hologram?And when you're an astronaut, they let you do it. There's a joke about your anus in there somewhere.

Get some help...Hey /u/SophieOfMacklenburg could you share a source for this clip please? :)what no $TSLA ?This is the most retarded thing i have seen today, and im not even shockedI bought $10,000 worth of  Pltr when it first opened. Didn't know anything about it. Just came across it on the discord chat. Got it at just under $11. The plan was for a quick profit (I'm new to investing). It dipped down to $10 and I panicked and sold. Lost like $700 (or something like that) in like 30 mins. I definitely regret not sticking it out. But I took what I lost, went the safe route and diversified. But I can still be WSB gang right?Did the palantir lock up period and last week?  Was that why it hit a bottom January 4th? And are we on our way up? And will demo day January 26th matter?  About $3,000 in options wondering if I need to go up on that or pull my money outI threw all my life savings in PLTR. I have 9500 shares.  \nDon't be pussies.STOP SPENDING MONEY ON AWARDS AND BUY THE SHARES!Great pep talk , all in on $SQDiversification is for democrats.Every red dAy is just a discounted ticket to mars!I also choose this guys square hole.square hole!What hole does the \ud83d\ude80 go in?IQ 100000This hits too close to homePLTR = surveillance, big data, AI, cybersecurity, intel, international , commercial and US customers.

House call if they dip below 35% and an immediate exchange call at 25% equity. They might be able to stretch it out but they will have to sell something to cover or bring in more trendies.I don't own any GME but these meme are something else\ud83d\ude02My favorite movie and scene of all time.yo i bought at 38 does that mean 0% for me then??GME gang welcomes every bagholder \ud83d\udcbcShould i go in with a leverage x2 maybe just to get as many shares as possible?Wait, is Melvin winning? What is going on? Retreat?We're all selling at open and using the gains for more PLTR?First of all it's Macedonians in English and Makedones in Greek(-lish). Makedonians doesn't exist.\n\nThey were considered savages by the Athenians just like the Athenians were considered boy lovers by the Spartans. City states weren't in the best of terms at the time and political rivalry between them doesn't change their ethnic composition. Theyre all descendants of the same tribes give or take, speak the same language and believe in the same cultural traditions.\n\nMoreover, Philip was actually from Argos.May I ask why are people doing this considering all the news around game stop and where the company is actually headingCan you make a part 2 of this meme where that paper hand cripple ass mf leads the Persians behind the Spartans? Cause that's going down rnIs someone gonna post the scene after this?Y\u2019all know how this movie ends right?I mean I like it but you do know how that movie ended right?Lol don\u2019t they all die in the end?I finally bought in.

Seems the whole point is to lead this sub off of cliffs. The short term gains are glorious but I can\u2019t see any future this stock doesn\u2019t crash after the artificial bubble pops. I like your style tho. That shit is cute.Can someone explain what happened here? Why is it up 100% in 2 days?Don\u2019t... don\u2019t the Spartans lose at the end \ud83e\udd7aUmmm, doesn't this end bad for us?Someone explain I'm stupidDon't we all die at the end tho...FUCK MELVIN GME YOLO GANG\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Ugh!

He told the tale1. You get a broker. Fund your account. If you're only using \"a few quid,\" then you'll want a discount broker like Robinhood. (Not sure what's available in the UK.)\n2. If you want to get involved in \"this sort of thing\" (i.e., what WSB does), just pick stocks you think will shoot up and buy some short-term call options. You need an options account to do that. Basically, you'll want to figure out how to calculate the leverage of positions you're considering (\\[delta \\* stock price\\] / call price). More is better if you think it will shoot up.\n3.

Fingerprints, DNA, known associations, all that shit.\n\nNow let me ask you: who do you think is managing all that data and doing the analytics for them, hmmmm? \n\nPLTR is an even longer play than GME, maybe even more profitable, but it won\u2019t be as sexy. We made history yesterday with GameStop. It\u2019s a wild success story, and you should be proud to be a part of it. Show that pride by buying more shares, and hold them until the Shorts are fucked into oblivion. Then we can focus on PLTR.\n\n#GMEgang\n\n**HOLD THE LINE**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16\ud83d\udc8e\u270bSelling 5 covered shorts, I hope I get assignedSold GME CC $25 1/15 for 2.50.

Some Capital Investment firm shorted GME to the depths of hell and back, but now their shorts are slowly getting pounded - causing this thing to go to the moon and beyond.The 300 *died*, they didn't *lose*. They held the pass long enough for war to be agreed upon and the army mustered.Shhfuck everyone who comes between us and our tendies and video games!!!All my homies hate Melvin.Strap your boots and put on your condoms cosmonauts we\u2019re going to the fucking moon some of you were going to ejaculate some of you were going to die but we will be legends for a life time!!!What did I do to you manDeepFuck MelvinYou got it at 24 this morning?

They will bleed this week!I'm waiting for it to dip a little more, but I liquidated this morning so that I could double down on GME at the right moment too.YesThey want things to be one way\n\nBut it's the other wayI want an ELI5 too. I have no vested interest but i can't see how GME can sustain long term as a business. Why the did the wsb collective decide it's a battle worth fighting?\n\nEdit: nm, this post explained plenty\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx5wu9/fuck_melvin_capitalSeriously, no one could have summed up this feud better than you just did.  \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udd25Never piss off the internet.

Do you own workShhhhh don\u2019t use that word it\u2019s just about memes rememberIt\u2019s a meme to buy GME, not manipulation jeez, that\u2019s boomer talk we millennials and Gen z up in this shitNo, this is using the rules of the game against the elite who used sketchy mechanisms to sell more of something than actually existed to screw over average investors.  They sold more GME shares than they could technically own.  One of ours saw a cheap company and is making something good out of it and we are in it because it makes more sense to us than the garbage reports Citron or Hindenberg put out.  Those guys are market manipulators.No.  \u201cSqueezing\u201d an over sold short actually brings the stock to a more fair market balance. \n\n\nSelling more shares of a company than the number of shares that exist is potentially manipulation and does not help the market come to a fair valuation.  \n\n\nThe argument is that they essentially diluted the fair market value by over selling the shares.  \n\n\nSo, it\u2019s a free market righting itself, by saying \u201coh if those are worth $x diluted, then when the dilution is removed they should be worth more\u201d.  It\u2019s math. It\u2019s free market.  \n\n\nTo stop that, or regulate buying over shorted stocks, would be diminishing the free market.  Which is the opposite goal of financial regulation.Its quite literally notStrictly speaking\n\nProbablySomeone said that Melvin Capital increased their short position[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)  \n\n\napparently this is delayed 20 mins.

How far out do you recommend I buy the call?Extremely, last I checked everyone was laughing at those who grasped to their GME stonksSo that your broker cannot lend your shares for shorting without your permission.

Us seeing an overextended fund, engaged with an even shadier insitutions behind them, capitalizing on them is not illegal.  That's savvy.\n\nWhen stated institutions are *naked short selling* shares that *don't exist*, sir, that is illegal.  Of course, its already been mathematically proven beyond a reasonable doubt that is exactly what they were doing, so, at that point, they squeezed the shit out of themselves.  *Of course* they were going to get long squeezed by the same autistic retards as well.  Why the hell not?  Those options were juicy as shit.  Unlike them, the people selling those calls *are covered by shares and/or cash*.  The callers don't have to borrow anything.  So you can see a scenario, where someone like me, whom sees a situation where I can literally make 10% return *of my entire portfolio* in two god damned days *with little to no risk* who has a fuckton of capital selling .  Well, you can see where those call sellers are coming from.  Besides the shorts pathetically to unload -20k puts in a way that doesn't get them prosecuted/bankrupt, you got us, the *savvy* ones gobbling up literal *tens of thousands of shares* to turnaround.\n\nThat all adds up to a squeeze.  That is simple market dynamics.  But, the important part, is *who was doing the illegal thing that led to perversion that led to this situation*.  That sir, is the insitutions who were naked short selling.  Feel free to report 'em to the SEC.  Most of us already did.... how dumb can a company be?  They are facing off against not only 1.8m autist, but also any trading firm that secretly watches us from the  shadows.So I think that means somebody was selling calls (another way to short a stock), but seemingly bought up the volume to close that position out (this demand spiked the price). Basically, it means the short squeeze if fully on because the shorts are starting to flip.Nvm, for some reason, Indians cannot invest in US derivatives. FML no tendies for me.\n\nI hope Dalal street is as wild as Wall Street.You will, because it's happening. \nGod i love i discovered gambling - Mondays are my favourite days.

Don\u2019t take financial advice from this sub.\n\nBasically the rule of thumb is not to invest money you can\u2019t stand to lose. Stocks are always safer because you can exit before things get really bad, aka you lose money but not all of it.Cannot give advice on timing. It depends on your own circumstances.IV is one of the metrics used to price options. GME IV is insanely high so premium is expensive. If IV comes down the premium will be much lower and you may not make gains even if the price moves in your favor.It means buy callsHey, on the plus side, that means you've survived ten years in this game. That's no mean feat!Not for longIt ends with their outcasts retard betraying them.[deleted]bruh the poetryAnd also as many shares as you can.

Which is not necessarily a lossNot that many new ratings thoughCut the cord and buy GME to holdGame stop is failing as a company.

OP is a fuck tard, and is now subject to an SEC Insider Trading investigation. Fucking autist.Promotion to Executive VP, Investors Relations.Lmao you win.Bezos is pissed.He learned from the best like Elon, always add in my opinion at the end and you're goodI asked a service rep this same sort of question today, she said essentially the same thing.\n\nLets hope my 7/31 $3200 call works out (I bought back my short leg of my vertical call spread today).\n\n13k for one single option riding on Amazon will be interesting.we should probably start a go fund me campaign for the poor ladHe did say it's he's personal opinion.This is clearly bill watersSeems to be a lot of Amazon gift cards he's trying to sell in his post history. May check out...If Billwalters is Leo, and this call goes on to print, we need OP and Leo to go the Ellen show or something. What a beautiful story this is turning intoLeo\u2019s HR will be like LOLZ. He definitely isn\u2019t on the corporate accounting team. Solid company pump. If reprimanded, tweet to Elon, he will hire Leo on the spot for that loyalty.Hahah this is Elon MuskHi I am Jeff Bezos. Congratulations on your new promotion to VP of investor relations. You'll be reporting to J Powell on Friday.That\u2019s not how it works.  You buy AMZN calls so you don\u2019t have to work there.I doubt its you. My guess is Leo is Anand from Bangalore, indiaMods can we at least get this guy some flair?Sec this guy right hereRest in piece Leodont worry billy, you are a CSR You arent privy to MNPI.I can feel your pain in that \"haha\"Are you a fellow degenerate gambler?Bill fucking waters long time no see!Its fake, don't worry you had nothing to do with this photoshop postBlur out Leo\u2019s name.Yolo your last paycheck on AMZN.hahaWell Op, what'd you rate him?I knew you were one of us retards.mam, this is a wendysNice!LolBased online person.  \n\nSeriously though man this shouldn't fuck with your job.  Hope this doesn't make waves.Why do i  find this hilarious?Brian LaFevre confirmed. He got off.Don\u2019t worry Leo you\u2019ll just get a final warning and be told not to speculate on these things.Hi Leo - I hope that's not really you because if it is, you might want to cash out any of your stock before you get fired.This is fukin wendy's.....I know that bitch.Thats insider trading \ud83d\udc4cActuallyKeep it here for punishment, you made me get fingerprints on my monitor trying to scratch off the schmuckle at the end of the word 'Thats'.Fuck this guy got fired lol[No you aren't, stop lying for karma.](https://imgur.com/h9AcMYq)Made me chuckleI can tell you their logistics and warehousing has been a Cuban missle crisis level clusterfuck since March. You can also sleuth through r/amazonfc to get an idea of how safety measures have impacted productivity (spoiler: it piss)Nah just OP. This is public info now and you\u2019re clear to trade.Only if you act on this info and manage to make a fuck ton of money -- they won't go after small fry. Too expensive.\n\nAlso, we got 'tipped' which is difficult to prove; all evidence relating to making calls on the info is circumstantial at best. But if you made, say a million bucks, you'll probably have an FBI inquiry if A this post is real (Leo was investigated as an actual employee, and B, an inquiry into Reddit logged your IP on the thread).\n\nOP on the other hand is fucked.I\u2019m pretty sure that this information provided by a fucking customer service rep. would not be considered material non-public information by any court in the country.For OP yess... for us? Nope... this is a public forumWhat\u2019s the return policy on your portfolio value?Leo is buying puts 100%. The gay name is all I need to know\"career\"If leo\u2019s thinking they gonna beat, its gonna tank for sure. RIP leo and RIP bag holdersI would 100% use eBay as a broker if I could by options on there.My mail man literally has ASS LOADS of eBay boxes every day. I\u2019ll be getting calls soon.Just do a debit spread lolHopefully MarketWatch sees this and gets a new job for Leo tooWith this level of solid effort, he is above market watch.Flawless logicCan he be in legal trouble for saying that?8/hr * 40hr/wk =$320 gross per week\n\n320 * 40% + 600 means Leo is taking home... enough extra to short TSLA with ODTEDon't worry. Leo is just a code name for Jeff Bezos.I knew AZN was going to crash on Monday when someone here who didn\u2019t understand the difference between share price and market cap said they had callsdouble downThat may have been true years ago, but now with the ease of access to trading I don\u2019t think we will ever have a \u201cprofessional\u201d equities market ever again. And thank god for that.You don\u2019t think amazon has some sort of AI to sift through all chats?I get this a lot working with Indian call centersOkThat wouldn't really do anything. Just the name \"Leo\" isn't enough to identify the guy, its the text of the conversation that would enable identifying him. That's true whether the name is censored or not.Just a first name probably isn't enough to identify the guy anyway. If they were gonna find him they'd probably do it by using the content of the conversation.It\u2019s already priced inThat\u2019s just like.. his opinion, man.that actually makes me curious. Obviously in this example its kinda tongue in cheek but where does it cross the line between insider info and just asking a friend who works at a company how business has been goingIt\u2019s been posted on a public forum, not insider anymore \ud83e\udd2aHow on earth can they prove a customer success rep has quarterly numbers ... just curiousSEIZE SEIZE SEIZE1 upvote = 1 bear fkI used to sell timeshare at WYND. During our morning sales meetings they would tell us what's budgeted (expected sales) and tell us where we were at for the month for our location (actual sales). They would also tell us \"all locations are smashing budget\", and shit like that.\n\nI wouldn't consider a sales position a grunt though. Sales are the lifeblood of every company. SDR's and AE's for AMZN AWS platform have the insider information we need to know though.\n\nLeo is a grunt though, and he doesn't know shit, including the evidence that will get him fired is now on social media.LOL you'd be surprised what some of the largest companies are willing to disclose either directly or indirectly to the lowest of members if they're paying attention and catch it.My sources say noCalls on Leo, Benzos sees that he\u2019ll make him a VP\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I'm dying lol.7.25p hilariousLmfao!Is he going to get it? Because this picture says [Otherwise](https://i.imgur.com/onNdpuF_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)He's a five star man!Username checks outWhat?? Bullshit, i am jeff bezos and i just saw thisDJ Bezos?Steam Engine BezosALWAYS BUY CALLSLol. No. Go to McDonald's and ask the cashier if they think the stock will go up or down. He says \"well, I think down because we've sold fewer burgers than normal\".. no one gives a shit.\n\nYou act on that information? No one gives a shit.Lol. An opinion on a customer service guy. No judge is going to throw leo in jail for that. Well at least if hes white.I bet the sec catches like 1 percent of insider tradingLol....And justified it with non material public information. Leo is good.This is macdonaldsFucking bill waters!  That rascal!And this is clearly Jason 10Bill Posters will be prosecuted!Classic bill waters.BILL WATERS IS INNOCENTSir please stop going through my post history I'm already fucked as it isHe also has a 4450c 8/21. Bullish.That is kinda odd... you can practically buy anything on amazon, besides cash I guess.[Nope, just a run of the mill karma whore unfortunately.](https://imgur.com/h9AcMYq)Seems legitI thought Ellen was cancelled. I'd rather go on CNBC and get my name out there for a new job b/c I'm surely fooked from this post[deleted]Why don\u2019t we just pay Chris Hansen to read a bunch of questions and we have these two record their answers?Cause a recession to prove it's really youThis guy fucks.It's literally our job to have the whitest name possible to appeal to the customer base.Apparently I gambled my job away by giving my own opinion where i shouldn't have.my packages are all on time so how does this affect costumer satisfaction or earnings at all?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: meant no disrespect to the workers. sucks if they get endangered. was only focusing on the effect on share pricesI can personally confirm we've done more work during the lockdown in UK than ever before, although it has considerably slowed down since UK started relaxing lockdown rules.OP is only guilty if he traded, and I'm not sure the SEC goes after people trading $58 worth of a fractional AMZN share.Which is most likely why they\u2019ve done itDepends, did you say \u201ccan\u2019t go tits up\u201d within the last 30 trading days?he is u/billwatersIt sure beats robinhood investing$1.15/hr might be a good living wage wherever tf Leo is living>These calls are faulty and not as described I want a full refund or I'll leave you bad feedback, and will not be sending them back.Ive been using ebay alot lately because everything on there is cheaper than amazonThey just sold classifieds part of their company for 9 billion dollars. SP should jump off this news no?He can't afford that either with his 300 bucks account from the thread from this morning.He doesn't know what a debit spread is and neither do ILeo definitely gonna be needing a new gig soonPeople I work with are into PLUG, I asked \"what does PLUG do?\", answer \"I have no idea, I like the name\".  Oh lord.If stocks crashed every time an idiot here bought calls, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are.[deleted]Never heard of the call center economy? They track EVERYTHING those agents do.they will gladly assist you with this onethen censor the text and just leave the name...Fair pointIt crosses the line when you make enough money to piss someone offLeo the customer service agent undoubtedly has no access to insider information. He even stated this was his opinion, based on increased online sales. That\u2019s completely public information, the opposite of insider info.I think it's only insider if this dude has access to earnings metrics instead of just giving his opinion. Or if he knew of some new deal or venture on delivery services that had not gone public.I think you have to be a certain level of \"rich\" for SEC to bother investigating you for insider trading. Martha Stewart? Yes. Joe Schmoe trader with his 5k Robinhood account? Probably not even worth their time>Leo is a grunt though, and he doesn't know shit,\n\nLeo = Dead Punk Bitch100% this\n\nI was interviewing for a position at a company called Americorp and they told me so much about the company\n\nIt\u2019s going public in about a year and I\u2019m going all in on it, they make so much fucking money it\u2019s not even funny,\n\nMore debt = more profit for themCan confirm... I work in manufacturing, everyone down to the lowest assemblers have all our financials revealed during company wide meetings. I'm not sure why. We're all sworn to secrecy and all have signed NDA's. Honestly it's bizarre. I could be back there making more of the product instead of being harangued for an hour so that the sales department can suck their own dicks in front of the people who actually produce the goods.\n\nOr, worse, winge about how our numbers are down and it's clearly the fault of the production team. Nevermind that materials were late and that we had nothing to assemble.I work at a company everyone knows of and it\u2019s crazy the access I have to data, I\u2019ve never bothered to look through it but if I did I\u2019m sure there would be many insightsMmmm...benzos....Is it because we are retards or reddit stopped hating emojis?I don\u2019t understand :(You son of a bitch>If Amazon bosses see this, Leo is gonna go tits up.\n\nI'm a real retard here. Got tricked twice today.You bitch of a sonBitches son you are.Well done \ud83d\udc4fBruhYes, but he is no golden god.Oh fuck that got me\n\nI chuckledClub Amazon?No this is Patricksir this is wendiesSir this is a casino.This is beansThe removal of your SahBabii post shows how bad the mods are of HHH, so much quality OC but let\u2019s listen to bronkhampton againNow the SEC won't let me be[deleted]Can i buy calls?Not tendiesAnd womenTbh i would have never thought a csr would have even responded to my question if I had asked! WSB legend in the making especially if the earning are beat.I wish I was SEC so I could get some free insider trades in exchange for not prosecuting the real crooks on Wall Street.This is actually a brilliant idea. Would easily go viral and result in both Bill Walter's and Leo's (but mostly Leo's) fame... and cement Chris Hansen's cult status and take his fame to new levels.Or gets fucked by IV crushYou should delete this comment immediatelyIf HR can't get you for the OP they'll get you for this, actual retard.My agent was once named Yynaloo and I couldnt even find a country for that name.Are you actually him though?The fact that your anime body pillows and subscribe & save on anal lube have arrived on time is little evidence of anything when the average top level category has a couple hundred million listings. The main impact to EPS is going to come from covid related spending to make FCs safer. Efficiency has plummeted. Inbound inventory shipments typically take a few days at most to get checked in and received, now they are taking weeks. So stuff goes out of stock, it goes backordered, it takes longer to get distributed, ship times increase and sales go down. But I'm predicting a beat on revenue and miss (near zero or slightly negative) EPS.Hey be nice I bought an STT 75.5C 8/21, I know I'm retardedSaying \u201cEZ money\u201d or telling your friends how to trade in the last 30 days can also play a major factor. TRUST MEGambling has negative expected value, being unemployed beats robinhood \"investing\"Bangladesh, and $1.15/hour would be pretty good there.I dont get how most people dont see this.  I would reckon it's in the 90% or more realm that eBay has the better deal.I used to be a big time eBay seller, mostly wrestling shoes in my day. I quit using it once they started double fisting me with seller fees and PayPal transaction fees. Went rogue and used Flickr because Instagram wasn\u2019t a thing back then lol. \n\nStill love eBay but am on the buying side nowMost retards don\u2019t care if it\u2019s $2 cheaper on eBay, but it\u2019s a kind of a muscle memory to open the amazon app and just buy it especially when you are a prime member. Actual question: How are the delivery times right now? Still delayed by weeks or is it getting back to 1 or 2 day delivery?You literally can though. I went ahead and looked and a debit spread where you buy a 3140c and sell a 3145c both 7/24 would only set you back 187 dollars\n\n\nShould you do it? Probably not. But the option existsLong an option\n\nShort an option farther OTM\n\nYour profits are capped at your second strike price, but the option comes cheaper. If you want you could just buy multiple contracts with your saved moneyDamn. I want to short it so bad but I\u2019ve gotten burned going against meme stocks so I probably won\u2019t. \n\n\u201cRetards can pump longer than you can afford to roll puts\u201d\n\n- Warren BuffetI 100% do hahah. This is criminal. Hilarious, but criminal.\n\nAmazon isn\u2019t a celebrity. It\u2019s a massive fucking company?They usually do the needful for me.This is the correct answer(( and the way you don\u2019t piss them off is by giving them a cut ))And you dont donate to that someones favorite charity or causeIncreased online sales maybe insider infoThis lol.  People in here don't know what insider trading is.  Unless they are giving cs reps access to financial documents this ain't insider trading.>More debt = more profit for them\n\nThe HTZ way, nice work budYeah I was just a mechanic for a extremely large company almost everyone has a product of in their home and we would stright up get told the exact numbers in millions/thousands as to how our revenue and profit was doing. \n\nThe company is private but a lot of the customers aren't and I may have known a particular rental car company was going out of bankrupt since March but didn't buy puts because I'm a dumbass when considering my non corporate or managerial position and fact I wasn't even actually \"told\" pretty sure I could have legally participated in.Hello daddy.HELLO SECCalls on XANIa whole lot of of column A, a bit of column B7.25 is his current hourly pay and puts on that because he might loose the job \ud83d\ude02I was thinking 7.25 is min wage which but technically if he loses his job his stock drops to zero so that's infinite tendies. Can't divide a put by zero[deleted]It's the federal minimum wageAt least it's not Peyton ManningAt least an honest one.Son, you are bitchesThis is Jake from State Farm.[deleted]Does wendies sell tendies?Thanks King, will do while I'm most likely unemployed. \u266b \u266cpull up with a stick let it hit \u266b \u266cOr let me be me so let me see, they tryna shut down my 4000C, but the orders empty without meI paid a $15k tax bill with Amazon gift cards to a nice man with a thick Indian accent over the phone. I found it a bit odd, but I guess that's how the IRS works now.I sure hope the electric company at least returns my card thenI can literally pay my capital one credit balance with amazon gift cards.Do you have any issues with Amazon shopping I can assist with? I am also training to assist with AWS so any cloud questions try shooting my way.The Elon\u2019s Degenerates Show!Almost every company\u2019s outsourced CSRs do this. \n\nSource: KarenWelcome to WSB, he is right at home hereHe probably went balls deep on AMZN calls and is now just YOLOing hardhavent heard much about prolonged shipping times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand even if shipping times increase a bit during rona, where else would people take their business? A physical store? LMAO[deleted]100%. I do so much more shopping on eBay even if it's to save a dollar or two. I always shop around to see where I can get the best deal on an item. It's usually not Amazon.This is the kind of shit I need. I\u2019m working with $100 right now and I\u2019m constantly furious I can\u2019t jump into bigger options.Well tempt me with a good time! Done and done! Thx for the idea.Worked well! Thanks!RH won\u2019t let me sell calls without either owning 100 shares or having the capital to back it up. Is this a RH only feature?As long as they revert back to let you know hence.Or re-election campaignWould be a stretch, but I suppose it could be argued. But honestly if the SEC pursued him in any way, that would be a ridiculous case to prosecute. I would represent Leo pro bono if necessary haBest to err on the side of caution when it comes to insider trading.\n\nProbably you'd have been fine as there would have been a lot of dots to connect to link you to small fry trades, and the info you had was probably not on paper, but still. If you could have made trades worth your while, then they'd be big enough to garner scrutiny.$7.25 is the minimum wageDo they really make only that much per hour wtf?you have no idea how puts work and I love itNever forget oil going negativeOhhhhh I didn\u2019t realize that people on here know enough about astrology to make inside jokes about specific dates. Makes sense because one of the only things as retarded as day trading is fucking magical zodiac signsThis crew doesn't recognize the minimum wage anymore? It's a bubble for sureoh thats a double take i was just referring to the federal minimum wage lolI miss that one actuallySir, this is a casino...LameChicken tendies.Wendies TendiesFJust buy AZN calls, you'll be okWhat a coincidence, that kind Indian gentlemen assisted me too. He said he was giving me a refund from Amazon and accidently gave me too much money so I had to buy a few hundred dollars of gift cards and read them off to him to pay Amazon back. What a stand-up dude.Pretty sure you owe another 15k in taxes but I\u2019ll be nice and let you pay in reddit gold insteadHow can I make tendie rain with AWS cloud?Does AWS have something better than what I\u2019m paying Dropbox $99 a month for?I find myself shopping at Walmart for hust about everything, but for stuff i cant find there, eBay has it covered.  You right thoDepends, Walmart doesn't carry OOP comic book TPBs.Saves a dollar or 2\n\nProceeds to lose 5k on TSLA FDs\n\nGotta love WSBSelling uncovered calls has undefined risk so pretty much no one lets you do it unless you're really experienced and have a lot of margin. You need to select both the short and long call at the same time. To do this just long press the option and it turns into a checklist kind ofI got AIDS from these commentsRe election campaigns are for buying politicians. You buy the press and courts via charitiesactually less after payroll taxes and insurance. America is so fucked \ud83d\ude2dputs are when stonk go down more stonk go down the puttier it isI won\u2019t son, I won\u2019t.shit now i gotta start trading my zodiac, fuckPeople in WSB come from all walks of life and backgrounds. It's the only place dems and repubs get along for the sole purpose of getting tendies.  You can be gay or as fat as a cow and nobody cares!Trading zodiac is the tits[deleted]It\u2019s 15$ where I live, so yeah you could say I\u2019m pretty rich[deleted]No way! That kind Indian gentleman contacted me recently about an inheritance from his father the deposed king! Also, I think he was Nigerian.The nice Indian gentleman called me too, but instead of giving him amazon gift cards, I called the FBI and had him SWATed\u2014whoops.Only thing raining is tears out my eyes bruhFfs, my account was level 2 options and I had to manually upgrade it to level 3. If I knew this earlier I could have saved so much loss, or I would have lost more, who knows in this market.Amazon minimum wage is $15/hrOMG bro do you not know which way stonks gousername check outCan I be a gay bear? Asking for a friendAnd it's 3 days from now which means he was saying he'll be fired immediately.eh i mean thats the federal minimum wage, most places dont use it as they have state and local minimum wagesWow that\u2019s crazy! This Indian man is a scholar and a gentleman. He recently contacted me about my car warranty being expired for my 2004 Toyota mustang. He had me give him credit card numbers (I lost all my money in my bank so I gave him 2 $500 prepaid cards). He\u2019s really a stand up guy if you ask me.Probably save lol, credit spreads vs just shorting one leg is a bit more iffy, but if all you've done up to this point is buy options, imo at least, debit spreads are much better because you can make much more on much lower movement with the same risk (or if you prefer, just make less on less movement with less risk)Leo will be an \"exceptional\" employeeEven their 3rd world  customer service employees?HahahaPolice officer here, I got called to a possible fraud complaint where the same indian dude scammed a nice old couple. Turns out it was not a scam and he looked me up and found out that I had an outstanding IRS bill for 15K too. But all good now I paid him with the Amazon gift cards. Wow, I am sure gald I am a police officer, saved me from IRS problems!I definitely understand them from a fundamental point of view. By that I mean I watch a lot of YouTube.\nI just thought they were a privilege enjoyed only by the rich.I guess maybe not those guys, but sure. They have some employees that work for contractors. This guy looks like he is somewhere along those lines because of the acute accent above the sThe guy must be Canadian.Imagine how embarrassing it would be if you had to arrest yourself, and then if you resisted it would be a felony.Most brokers require you to have (some not alot) of margin to use spreads. No idea why RH is the exception\n\nRH allows anything with defined risk I think if you can put up the collateraldo you know how execution of spreads work?\n\nfor example, i have uvxy call debit spreads. 26/32. expiring august. \n\nlet\u2019s say vix pops to 33 this week. will the spread automatically be worth the max amount? if not, is there a way i can exercise to get the max profit?Usually people will just try to close out a spread early instead of executing. As for if you can execute certain legs but not others, no idea as I've never tried that before. If I was to guess though I doubt they would let you just execute the long leg of a spread and keep the short leg because that could just turn into a naked call which as discussed, is really fucking dangerousyeah. Problem is, from my experience, spreads are not worth their max amount before expiration. If you don't believe me, try making a completely ITM spread, for example, UVXY 25/26 debit call spread. It's worth like 75 instead of the 100 max value--which kinda makes sense, given that it can still go down before expiration. idkI usually either let my spreads expire or I sell early for a profit so I can free up capital. I don't really mind whether or not they hit max value earlyI gotcha. Good luck with your trades!", "linkFlairText": "Shitpost", "totalAwardsReceived": 1, "rating": -0.5679573164226611}]
