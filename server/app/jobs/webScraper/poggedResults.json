The day trader guys might be very right that it could pop in the next day or two AND the OP could also be right if AMZN tests that MA from underneath a month from now then drops. \n\nBe more specific in your timeframe if you're gonna slapfight damnit!Switch to the Black theme in WeBullur just making all this shit up aren't you?how can you tell it's a bull trap from the chart?SCOTTY DOESNT KNOW ! SCOTTY DOESNT KNOW ! \n\nAnd you\u2019re scotty$2200 here we come!!How is apple a bull trap? It\u2019s at a PE ratio of 15. the magic mspaint lines reveal all!I'm a TA trader but I'm sorry this is really bad TA you're posting.\n\nFirst off TA is much clearer on the daily chart. The weekly chart doesn't show enough information to see the trap form.\n\nYou need to let the bull trap form first. Looking at the amzn chart on the DAILY, it looks more like a bullish pattern ready to break out.\n\nAlso it's fucking Amazon man. Literally the biggest bull. \n\nWith that said.. I believe Amazon will go down in the long term this year, but that's purely speculation not based in TA.\n\nGood luck[deleted]Pls GE bull trap too...Delet this famThis lying cunt jus tryin\u2019 to buy calls on the cheap.\n\n@Bitch-ass OP: nice try but you suck at being convincing worse than your moms sucking my asshole post-shit, no-wipe, thai-hot Pad Thai diet.\n\nMods, ban this bitch OP for dishonoring us with such a *lousy* attempt at shilling bs. He should *at least* have the goddamn common courtesy to put forth half the effort of your typical Goldman analyst downgrade. Unacceptable.Good ideaOp doesn\u2019t know... he pretends he knows cz he\u2019s fag lolIt broke multi-year up trend line, will touch that line on the underside and resume downtrendAll the bullish idiotic backlash is making me so much more confident, actuallyTell that PE logic to MU longs Standard trailing PE is a pretty terrible fundamental valuation metric. It's just easy to understand and calculate. \n\nForward PE is what your looking for hereWhat are you talking about? Weekly and monthly charts are great, there is no one best way. Regardless, we are at resistance with a doji on the daily. The market is going DOWN. Not speculation, facts.This is why I just wait to go long for years, good luckHoly FuckLmaoJust gonna make another great call, fam> bitch ass-op\n\n***\n\n^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This comment was inspired by )^[xkcd#37](https:\/\/xkcd.com\/37)No it won't.

Not even a month ago it was back at this price on sharp upward movement. \n\nYou TA people sound like fucking retards. \n\nIf Amazon gets Jedi and 10 billion dollars will it gap up? Stupid fuck.you don't even have a position though lets be honest. prove me wrong breh so if you think tomorrow is another green day and there\u2019s massive momentum amazon won\u2019t get carried and break through your magical lines like a black man on pcp?\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\udd2bIf your trading the weekly go ahead. Using both charts work best. On the daily, the doji looks to me like it could flag for a few days then breakout.\n\nRegardless this week is all about the China deal. If nothing happens, then the vix drops and stocks pop. If a deal is made then stocks RIP till 2019 Feb.I hear you. I bought most of my AMZN shares in 2014 - between $300 and $350. I usually make $2k a month selling calls \u2014 but every now and then I get assigned and have to rebuy. Still thinking might stay under 1695 until next weekBest call *is* a call. Return some tomorrow, then steady climb as institutions establish positions through the run up to 4q earnings.\n\n$AMZN rockets in flight !!!  (*pop*)YawnLol how biased are you? Resorting to insults like a child, pathetic...I'm net short by holding cash, I don't retardedly buy 50 contracts, sorryI buy stock long. You wanna buy options, it's up to you. I'm looking at 2-5 year time framesGreat buy! Probably never see that price againBiased. Uses TA.   What?  I\u2019m biased because it\u2019s gone up 1650+ twice this month.\n\nSo it makes no sense.thought so.  that means you don't believe in your own lil TA chart. your 'position' is not having a position, meaning you are not confident enough in your own 'research' to short AMZN. you're telling us AMZN is a bull trap, i.e. it's about to crash down again. yet... you dont actually believe this very strongly, because you dont have a short position. \n\n> I'm net short by holding cash\n\nYou are adorableSo you are poor and since you don\u2019t have skin in the game you are just guessing. Nice. PussyYawnLol then why are you here? I agree this may be a bull trap though. lol I hope not! I did stop buying more. Now I just throw all my money at TSLAOkay, let's chat in a week or twoThis is a standard chart, I didn't make it. I don't short anythingYes I'm poor, lmao do you hear yourself? Sounds like you're guessing on some calls.I'm interested to buy TSLA during recession, hopefully in the mid-high hundreds and AMZN around 1000Will the downward trend go back up?k, you screenshotted this chart to share with everyone saying it's showing that AMZN is about to crash. \n\nbut you dont actually believe this, otherwise you'd aim to profit on it with a short. \n\nsolid post OP\u201cI'm net short by holding cash, I don't retardedly buy 50 contracts, sorry\u201d http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/a1dazl\/amzn_traditional_bull_trap_same_goes_for_aapl_fb\/eaozotr\n\n\n-\nTalks about guessing.

Of course gme will hit $500\/share end of year, but for all other semi-retarded autist, lemme tell you why you should be buying $bbby right now before close. \n\n- Very well regarded Mark Tritton (former Target CMO) became a CEO just over a year ago. He\u2019s the only the 3rd CEO and 1st outsider in the company\u2019s history who\u2019s very optimistic about a turnaround\n\n- they\u2019ve sold non-core assets and expect to raise additional $350mm-$450mm in cash from non-core that will be pushed towards digital sales\n\n- Digital Comps up 94% YoY. Penetration online continues to grow drastically with a 31% annual growth rate\n\n- More digital means wider margins. Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. \n\n- They\u2019ve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That\u2019s 1\/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management \n\n- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. \n\n- EV\/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post. So that alone should put us at a fair value of $35\/share today. Based on forward EBITDA for 2021, that\u2019s $39\/share in the next 12 months. And that\u2019s not accounting for share buyback.\n\n\nSounds good right. But wait, there\u2019s more\n\n\n-BBBY is the 5th most shorted stock over $1 billion MC with 68% of short float. You all know #1, the other 3 are garbage.

I have long been tracking this company but I only recently got in with some skin in the game (disclosure \u2013 I own \\~3000 shares; I am also new to WSB:)). I also think Q3 is an important moment for the company given the institutional dynamics, but **I do NOT think holding through 12\/8 would be a good gamble** (which is why you are seeing several people sell their shares to buy in later). Instead, I think there is a better way to play earnings on 12\/8.\n\nFirst off, as everyone knows, Q3 results are going to be ugly. Some have made the argument that the market has already priced this in, but this is only partially true. **Market pricing is dictated by both event-driven probability and hype.** I would guess that the probability of GME missing consensus estimates is \\~50\/50 (note missing consensus estimates is different from negative growth which is guaranteed in this case). Nobody knows where things will shake out, so the market will price it as such. However, there is a tremendous amount of hype around this stock (for good reason in my humble opinion), which is why I think this stock is trading well heading into an earnings announcement for a turbulent quarter.\n\nNow, **one way to estimate performance is by using credit card activity as a proxy for performance**. We can then use this and compare it to consensus estimates by research analysts:\n\n*Same-Store Sales*\n\n* Telsey: -27.0% (as of 12\/2\/20)\n* Wedbush: -20.0% (as of 12\/4\/20)\n\n**If you look at credit card data scrapping services, it looks like the quarter will end down around 25 \u2013 30%** (based on the service you use). Obviously this is close to the Telsey number, but its worth noting that these credit card services slightly overestimated performance in Q2 (so the number will likely be closer to -30%). **Therefore, I have a feeling that this stock is going to sell-off significantly**, **making it a much better entry point versus pre-earnings.**\n\n**Personally, I am still long this stock, but it seems like the stock is going to drop in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, which is why I will be holding off from buying on Monday. I\u2019m definitely going to scoop up some more after earnings however!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy to answer any questions :)\n\n",

It might cause the loss of potential profits if you sell and have to average up on unexpected good news. \n\nIf you believe that we will go up, then you'll ultimately get there if it plays out that way whether or not you pull out and get back in.I think weak earnings are priced in despite the run up in share price. Shorts have continued to double down and I think anyone still in it is there for the squeeze. \n\nWhat will likely prevent a broad sell off will be positive guidance which is expected and probably not entirely priced in. I think after Cohen\u2019s letter, management is already shitting bricks so expect a very rosy forecast. I\u2019m sure the CEO is already trying to save his job so the way I see it he\u2019s not about to fuck this up.\n\nPositions: 2900 sharesWe're trying to kick start a short squeeze and you're telling us to sell. Fuck off Melvin Capital! I'm buying GME all month until I'm on the fucking moon \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80I think that Q3 results will be less important than future outlook, because as you said, everyone knows they suffered huge losses. Been in since 12 though, so it doesn't matter much to me. On the slim chance that there is a major shift in company structure or otherwise, getting in before earnings gets you exposure to any of that. There seems to be more upside than downside to me since they are expected to perform poorly, and any deviation from that, or planning for future events, can cause the stock to rise.You are missing something in your analysis that I need.\n\nYou are telling me that puts would be wise. Okay. That is fine. What you're not telling me is whether IV will fall. If the IV doesn't fall then you are better off simply buying puts and converting them into calls after earnings if you believe that the stock will fall.\n\nHowever I have a feeling that IV will *rise* after earnings substantially making it far worse to get in no matter the value of the entry point. Basically over time you'll be paying, for the same option, twice as much as you would have if you had held through earnings.\n\nThat is my only challenge to your analysis; if you're looking at shares, fine, you're right, but most people are looking for options here.Got $20 calls for april that are up about 100% and shares. Was just going to hold through earnings but now I'm considering selling the calls and holding the shares through. What do you guys think, maybe do that and buy the calls back after or just hold everything? I just feel like theres a chance they could have good guidance or maybe Cohen makes a move with earnings so I don't want to miss anything.I sold dec11 $20 covered calls for like $120\/contract and used that money to buy 14\/17c spreads for 12\/18. Near zero risk imonah. I'm bullish on Q3 because the b&m retail sector in general was able to achieve positive EPS. There's the CARES act to count on too to boost EPS2 words- Ryan CohenNo, the market is forward looking. Even if earnings are rough, they are going to announce how many stocks they bought or a new initiative and the stock will boom!\n\nThey have to nail this or RC is going to dismantle the bird.Going into earnings with shares and iron condors. Ready for anything (including bagholding).I sold 6 $15puts expiring next week. Would love for a dip to get assignedNice analysis. Personally I think it will ride into earnings and sell of either at them or slightly before. Going to pick up a short term 1 day trade, dump and then pick up again after the inevitable fall for the long termIf earnings are bad, won't that just push the short squeeze that much harder?And bad earnings is priced in, no one gives af about sales unless they do better than expected. This is all about guidance and Dogman taking over or not. This ain't your normal earnings retard.I\u2019m agreeing with you on this. I think the dip will get bought up pretty quick before it is too significant though.\n\nI\u2019m too afraid something unexpected will come up and push it up so I\u2019m holding longer calls and selling short term for the premium.[deleted]If one feels this way, sell covered calls and *do not* sell shares.  This is not something you want to time the market on.  You will be wrong and it will be to your detriment.Why not just buy some puts on Monday to protect downside and if it doesn't tank sell the puts on Wednesday?If q3 will be bad Cohen will swing his dick so hard even CEO will ask him to step in and end his sad life. If earnings will be good, stock will rocket harder than NIO when it was actually good meme stockNo way I get out of my position to avoid a bad reaction to earnings. That's how you miss the squeeze. If anything it would just be a good incentive to buy more. Maybe hedge with some cheap weekly puts.I\u2019ll be trimming some of my calls right before earnings to lock in gains but selling shares is not the move at allGme is a garbage company and a dumpster fire.... \n\nThe short interest and possibly of a short squeeze is appealing as well. \n\nBut I will not  buy it until the squeeze starts happening. If it gets over 20 I will start buying and use buy at market orders to help the squeeze. \n\nAfter earnings if it gets over 20 I'm in. But I dont think the numbers are going to be good with pandemic etc.... \n\nIt's a wait and see game...I think you make a reasonable, data driven point about the same store sales. \n\nIf we left out all the incremental initiatives\/items (rollout of nascent digital advertising, clarification of the MSFT partnership impact [Melvin is known to have called it a \u201cnothing burger\u201d and don\u2019t buy the lifetime rev share value as being material], any quantification of the blowout November performance & affirmation of market share leading allocations, etc.) then I\u2019d agree.  \n\nNo one fucking knows what\u2019s going to happen, it very well may dip, especially if (when?) the big shorts decide to get aggro and try controlling a negative narrative. \n\nI suspect that any post ER dip gets bought hard.\n\nPositions: 9000 shares, more than 100 $10C from Apr21 to Jan22, and nearly that many deep OTM LEAPSI keep saying this; I don't know why people suddenly think because they are planning to transition to an online store, they're going to go up from earnings. I am not even sure GME is the largest sale of this console generation either. All my local EB games got 4-5 consoles. Walmart, bestbuy and other places here were SELLING the console online release day still lol. EB games online wasn't selling any consoles 6 hours after it was on the website for preorders.\n\nPlus, people seem to forget earnings almost always causes a dip. Even when they post slightly above expectations.1. Timing the market is typically not a good call. \n \n2. Totally not suspicious that a several year old account with one other post (about a sitcom) is telling us all not to buy in.i agree with your assessment about q3 reports....but this has to be all about q4 and the future. what they plan on doing with the increase of holiday lockdowns and how they plan on capitalizing.I'm surprised you didn't mention the squeezeThis CC gonna be more hyped than SBAgreed.  I will happily purchase your GME shares at a fair fire sale price in a private transaction.I like your insight. What are your thoughts on \nBto 16c March expiry or  20c\nStc 18c                               22c\nBto 18p                               22p\nStc 16p all same expiry   20p\n\nUpon finding s\/r zones and backed by volume, ma, signals, etc, you sell a put at support and buy a discount call, sell a call at resistance and buy a discount put. sell the wings or sell the meat, I'm still figuring it out. Thoughts?Unusual option buying 12.11 17p bot support thisThis year horrible earnings have caused the price to rise whereas earnings that have beat have caused share price to lower.\n\nLoading upPriced inI was just asking about this on other threads. Too retarded to fully understand options so I\u2019m looking at shares. I have a RH deposit clearing on the 7th, are you suggesting to wait until after earnings report to buy?Shitty earnings are expected and priced in. If they  perform only slightly shitty they may get a pump.What about buying some puts to hedge shares into earnings. Then of it drops you can buy more and avg down and if it goes up u take a small loss and still in the big shares playYou son of a bitch I\u2019m inIf you own shares in this thing. I think the risk of potentially missing a news headline or an earnings surprise is too great. I got burned trying to do what you recommend. I had north of 3k shares and sold 400, 2 hours later Microsoft signed a revenue sharing agreement and GameStop was halted for trading. Then it shot up 50%. I\u2019m holding through at least the March earnings report. Keep in mind also, they are buying 63% of their short term debt early, 3 days after earnings...things can\u2019t be that bad if their cash flow is being used this way.2019Q1,2019Q2, 2019Q3, 2020Q2 CC data under reported sales.... Also have we baked in currency tailwinds from the dollar's vast underperfomance? I think we will be around 1bil in rev but positive EPS. There is your surprise.Ok so what\u2019s to like about this stock. As an outsider looking in, it just looks like an outdated business model with a management team that isn\u2019t making any changes. Please help me understand the hypeTo be frank eb games \/ GameStop has always been the last place on my mind as a gamer .. hate the store ... hate the people working there . There sales suck .. trade in values suck \n\nPeople buy games digitally right off the damn store on Xbox and PlayStation of steam bypassing these goofs altogether \n\nSelling a game console is at cost for them ... brand new games are profits or cents or a dollar I believe ...\n\nWhy is this place going up ?Illuminati confirmed if they beat their fucking ER when did PS5 start selling?Oh Look, we got a Alpha paperhand over hear. Go dumb ur shares with ur weak ass paperhands. Stupid boiWe see you SUS from Melvin Capital!yea for goodness sake, don\u2019t try to time the market.\n\nno one knows how it will go after earnings. Expectations are already shitty. No one expects anything good from Q3. Even if it does drop, it will recover quickly simply because of the many bull factors.\n\nEarnings is just a small factor. Guidance, new strategic initiatives, developments are equally or even more important.\n\nEdit: If you are really scared, sell covered calls because if price rockets, at least you secure some gains. If it does drop, at least you have some hedge. If you sell your shares, it\u2019s just... unwise. If you are willing to sacrifice a huge potential gain for a tiny loss then you might as well invest in ETFs...\n\nLike OP said, GME is going up in the long run. With a short squeeze, does it matter whether you entered at 14,15,16,17 or even 20s?Haha! Just sharing my personal thoughts\/analysis :)Thanks for your thoughts. I agree, long term this is going up. My commentary was just trying to shed some light on my short term perspective.I don't think maybe people have actually [read the letter](https:\/\/s.wsj.net\/public\/resources\/documents\/RC%20Ventures%20Letter%20to%20GameStop.pdf). This is some HEAT they have to respond to, and it better be good.Interesting perspective - congrats to you for being smart enough to get in on this last year! I agree that for the longer term, Q3 is meaningless, but I do think the market will react to any miss vs. the latest consensus numbers.i though iv falls after earnings report. can you expand on why you think iv will rise instead? thanks man.Thanks for the perspective u\/Everyman_B. You raise a good point - I can't comment on option strategy here as that is not my forte. This analysis was targeted at current\/future share holders.I wouldn't sell either. April calls won't be affected as much by IV or negative news.  I have a feeling after Earnings IV may increase and those same call may be the same price at a lower share price because of that.A split\/hedged risk sounds reasonable.\n\nYou never know what else they might still announce, apart from the un-interesting Q3 results.Nice. Yeah, I\u2019m too in the business of collecting premium, last position - sold $21 12\/11 calls for about $110 and bought some cheap-ass puts to hedge against earnings.Thanks for the perspective. To be fair, a lot of the B&M players were able to generate positive comps through COVID which will not be the case here. That being said, the CARES act could be an interesting dynamic.He is certainly a catalyst for this stock!They will have bought zero shares. Stop spreading this misinformation. Management clearly said they aren\u2019t buying back sharesYeah. Either way, it can go only upwards.\n\nActually, the chances of screwing up seem rather low.>, the market is forward looking. Even if earnings are rough, they are going to announce how many stocks they bought or a new initiative and the stock will boom!\n\nI agree with you that the market is forward looking. However, that assumes that they have forward-looking data which we may or may not have (i.e. depends on whether management discloses this information).Best of luck. Definitely important to have big cajones for this play!Interesting strategy. Thanks for sharingAppreciate it! Short term risk hedging could be a good way to play this as well. Best of luck.I don\u2019t think that bad earnings (on its own) would be the catalyst. Perhaps, this would prompt RC Ventures and Cohen to react, but this is a different issue.>selling short term for the premium.\n\nCool - best of luck!Yep - credit card data includes both online and in-store sales. Obviously, the data is imperfect, but it is good proxy given lack of data.I agree selling CCs is wiser than selling shares. However, if you're selling CCs when the squeeze could happen at any time, aren't you essentially trying to time the market that the squeeze won't happen during your CC selling? You'll miss out on gains if the squeeze happens and you have to sell your shares for way cheaperSmart. 20 seems like a good entry and might indicate the beginning of the squeeze. See you there fam!I whole heartedly agree that Q3 numbers are insignificant longer term (which is why I am still long). However, at the end of the day, Wall Street is Wall Street and they care about earnings beats\/misses.I think the squeeze has been mentioned enough for one day! That is definitely a plus but it could be weeks \/ months \/ years. I definitely can't predict that one haha!Haha glad this was helpful! Per the above, consider getting in AFTER earnings on 12\/8. You might be able to get a more attractive price :)Thanks for the comment. I would point you to several of the posts already made on this subreddit in the last week or so (can just google $GME). They have done a great job outlining the bull case here. That being said, you would need to have a much higher risk threshold here to make money given the large swings, so it's definitely not for everyone :)Short squeezeIt is an outdated business model as is. Hype will come from them actively making moves to conform to the current digital age and making improvements. There are a number of catalysts that can basically set off a rapid market buy, thus the hypothetical squeeze people are talking about. They paid off a significant amount of debt recently. There's also the new console cycle with the PS and Xbox. I don't know what GME will be in five years, but I do believe that this is a solid money maker in the very near term.>I play video games a lot and made stupid trade ins as a kid so now I know the fair value of this company\n\nIt's going up because the share price didn't \/ doesn't maybe reflect the value of the company.Guidance will be good.Sold $18 covered call for this week and sold $20 for next week. Its a good bonus for sharesWhen did the market ever move based on the quarterly report? Its all about the guidance bro. Go back to your mamaYou brought up some excellent points, though if someone were intent on selling out and getting back in I might recommend selling covered calls that net a ton due to the high IV. To hedge against missing out on a possible spike right after earnings, you could buy calls a few strikes above the ones you sold.Sharing your short term view while still holding the shares. GTFO dude, stop being a pussy and walk the talk.IV doesn't always fall after events. It's less an explanation and more of an observation; IV movement can actually increase or decrease at any time, most stocks aren't interesting plays of course which is why the IV falls so hard but for those that are IV can sustain or even grow. GME earnings is *not* the event sought so IV may not react at all.Earnings won't predict short squeeze so the IV might not get cut in half immediately after earnings. Typically earnings + guidance kills uncertainty\/IV but does not make up for other black swans like a unpredictable short squeeze. Even if RC doesn't try a takeover or GME doesn't offer a buyback the squeeze might still happen. \n\nRKT had the same level of IV but immediately dropped 80-100% after earnings, you could have sold 2021 $40 calls for $10\/contract and bought them back for $1-2\/contract two weeks later (even at a sh price of 25-28), I sold shorter dated puts and calls and made decent return, enough to still sell my RKT shs at $21 for a profit. I'm a bit more cautious selling cc's for my GME shs this time but if they get called away I'll take my 30% gains and move on.Got it. Well, then it is a fine analysis for what it is.Rip to your puts, if they were cheap they were otm and iv crush will kill them!And he filed an intent to purchase with the SEC if management doesn\u2019t make the changes he suggested. Its going to be an interesting few weeks.Who knows what they will announce. Buybacks are one possibility, a major game changer is another. Either way, they have to nail it or the great white shark known as RC will eat them for lunch! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude0ePorshe wasn't buying Volkswagen. Until they did.Like selling covered calls? I was thinking about doing that with GME before earnings..[deleted]I\u2019m selling 3 covered calls for $22 Dec 11. Someone is paying me $300 in premiums for this.to a degree.  my #1 concern regarding this call....is hearing them say they can\u2019t forecast q4 because of supply constraints from sony and microsoft and nintendo for consoles. from what i tracked this year....every company that did this got spanked.Or you may be buying in at a higher price.  I have been buying every time it dips under $16.  Bought 100 shares today under $17.  MM were holding price down today so $17 calls expired worthless.  I think it would have been at $18 otherwise.\n\nI think GME may be like Nordstrom and pump because the news wasn't as bad as they expect plus debt payoff, plus any 2021\/future plans.  They also still have $100M in stock buybacks that was already approved last year that they didn't use.What\u2019s the move long calls short calls or putsThank you. I\u2019ve been trying to look past these posts all week since it isn\u2019t PLTR but I\u2019ll have to do some DD this weekendThank you for the reply, what is the time frame that these catalyst are set to take place? It sounds like everybody is expecting earnings to be shit with good guidance into the future.\nDebt buy back is big, but have they announced anything as to what the plan is to digitalize?The company was closing stores left right and centre and pay stupid rent in dieing malls \n\nYou idiots realize that brand new ps5 is sold at cost for 499 ... these clowns don\u2019t make moneyIs guidance guaranteed? Other b&m retailers are not providing guidance in latest ER. Not sure why it would benefit mgmt to release now, during all this uncertainty.100% priced in.\n\nEdit: what isn\u2019t priced in is the Cohen taking over and their partnership with Sony digital sales on ps4 just wait for that catalystfuck thats good advice. just sold my first cc ever today on GME 20c 12\/11. Never thought about buying a call incase it fuckin moons suddenlyInteresting strategy - thank you for sharing.I understand your sentiment but I think he\u2019s genuinely trying to help people find a better entrance price and he raises valid, very real pointsThe ER and following investor call is exactly why IV has spiked. It would take a big announcement to make the IV go even higher afterwards. We're already at 225%+I appreciate that :)Don\u2019t spread misinformationThis might be the dumbest post I have read. This is about a Company buying back their own shares - which they announce ahead of time.\n\nAnother gambler that doesn\u2019t even know the basics of what they are buyingPerhaps, but I am sure there are experts here who know more about hedging. For my part, I will be holding off on buying before earnings completely.better to sell puts in case it spikes on good guidance. calls could lose your sharesAbsolutely. I\u2019ll dig that up and share. It\u2019s worth noting that most of these services are paid services, but I can share screenshots to the extent that is helpful :)Right. And if (not likely, but IF) $GME rockets up to $30 before Dec. 11, then you just missed out on like $2,400 (300 shares x $8\/per share appreciation).I also bought 101 shares for $16.81 each today. I can double the number of shares if the price drops a bit after earnings, but it's a guess at this point.I'd expect sometime between Q3 to Q4 earnings. Three month period, maybe. If Cohen doesn't like earnings, he has publicly implied* that he'll initiate a takeover, so that could be a catalyst. I'm sure anything they announce will be on Dec 8th. Anything can happen, so it's just sitting and waitingIf they don\u2019t provide guidance, shareholders will eat them alive. Especially after the whole Cohen ordeal.Yeah... you'll have to hope we don't gap up on Monday if you're wanting a call to protect your upside, or hope that we don't moon in general until you're out from under the $20c. Don't fomo, that's how people lose money. Theta gang is always a good play, though on a stock with moon potential like this you may want to modify your plays. \n\nSomething I did on RIOT was own ITM calls and sell call credit spreads, essentially making them covered call credit spreads. You're losing some premium compared to just the covered call, but you miss a minimal amount if we moon.No problem, feel free to ask questions.IV for GME has been this high for months. No one could possibly care about the earnings. To even say that is to not understand the GME situation. The short-squeeze definitely is not something regarding the earnings of GME.It's screaming... short me!Sorry I heard that on hereBut isn't the point to protect my position if it doesn't spike. How does selling puts do that?Yes. That\u2019s is the risk.  But your implying the stock might double in a week.Thank you, I\u2019ll do some DD this weekend!He never said anything of the sort. It is only implied in his letter.The investor call is where we expect the board to have to respond to RC since he sent it during the quiet period.No, that's just you after every GME commentI'm genuinely curious not being argumentative. I just started messing with covered calls and I dont think I grasp covered puts as clearly yet.. Reading up on it.It doesn't protect your existent position at all, I think he's trying to present it as an alternative to a buy-write.Still won't matter. Console cycle is where the money is. Cohen is ... well if Cohen didn't exist console cycle is where the money is anyway. Cohen is a weird variable.Short me!Selling a put when IV is high means you will collect the premium and possibly pick up more shares at a lower price. The premium you get when you sell it is your protection. And if it doesn't drop, you keep it anyway.Gotcha thanks for clearing that up. If I can ask one more question. So when you write a covered call you want it to match your shares. So 500 shares would mean 5 covered calls. Is it the same with selling puts or is the short position I'm opening independent of those shares?No, puts are secured with cash so if you sell a 15p you'd have $1500 used as collateral until the position is closed or you get assigned.Ah ok.

Not like he solid calls, which would've been even more stupid.Why do you hate money?I\u2019m a contrarian trader and love shorting high flying stuff, but the IV means it really has to fall hard and fast. Ideally you would short shares with some calls to protect you from the squeeze but there are no shares to borrow. So you\u2019re really fighting the flow on this one.If you did the reading, understood the company, understood the various directions GME could take on its new path, and having weighed it up decided that the bearish case still significantly outweighed the bullish case, this is a reasonable YOLO.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think you did.Dude get out right now at least wait until IV settles why are you doing this I genuinely don\u2019t want you to lose moneyat least you have the balls to put the money up and actually post puts.

They've done alright given their situation, but the short squeeze from institutions betting poorly is what's driving it up right now.Wait till this guy hears about omnichannel, streaming, electronic downloads, etcCalling them a video game retailer is so ignorant, first of all, like Tesla, when you have a once in a generation type genius in charge you are investing as much in the person as the company and their products, and secondly Ryan Cohen is going to completely rebuild the business for the digital age, 35-40 is the new floorFrom an options standpoint your break even is around $17. The IV is 170% and delta is only .1. There is support around the 17-18 range. Your best bet is GME crashes in Feb and March, and even then you can lose value in IV for not a lot of delta. \n\nWhy jump in front of the moving train this early?The hive mind is the strength of the sub though?

There was a post here a couple days ago that did the math on the combined might of WSB autists and it rivals some of the biggest institutional players when the horde is pointed in the right direction.They call that a Mushroom Tattoo in these partsAHHAAAHAHH BAI BAI MONEYLol really is a yolo \ud83d\ude02you only lose it all onceI genuinely hope you make a ton of $$$$$Remind me! 14 daysIdk ask your doc cause this is a retarded playGood point.My smooth brain only knows stonks go up \ud83d\ude80At least you bought far out to minimize IV. But yeah it\u2019s hard to short this stock right now, so it\u2019s a tough one for me. I\u2019ve also been burned on short squeezes before. And in my 15 years of trading, GME right now looks like one of those once in a lifetime events. Never seen short interest this high.Please don't joke about thatI think the squeeze will genuinely start next week.Shorts still haven\u2019t covered even with that last run, and that run is gonna force their hand this next week. This is going to $100 at the least, possibly $420.69 if enough people diamond hand it7:00 behind Wendy's as soon as I get off shift.Immediate defensive attitude clearly shows insecurity with being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b.  PUTS ON THIS \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08 OP.You literally just dumped your life savings betting on a meme stock retard.Stfu the whole point is to make money with risky trades not only sticking to bullish plays.watch the market shift in a year and retards like you are gonna get ass fucked on every play.  \nBe Autists\nNot RetardsI\u2019m having deja vu, stock down 10% and puts up 9%For the record I meant it in a sexual way, not aggressiveNo, just the Roth. And I\u2019ll fucken do it again!!\n\nThe only people being derided on wsb are those who challenge the hive mind. That should worry youIt\u2019s fine I will get lots of sexual pleasure jerking it to your poss porn.Lol we\u2019re deriding you because it\u2019s fucking stupid play that\u2019s gonna lose you thousands of dollars. This is you thinking you\u2019re some kind of edgy genius betting against the mainstream.Poss?500 gme shares 17.50 avg.\nHoly fuck. This could seriously go nuclear and hit 500+Did someone just got into put position on 13th? Oh their fked lmaoAll I see is boomersBan this guy, keeps posting bear shit every couple minutesBank of America sucks. Let's put it in their butts!Suck my ween Melvin Capital!Lol list of dead bodies.Your margin gonna get called like a whore at a sailors picnic. \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3bMelvin we know very well. How is boldy doing?GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 crush the \ud83e\ude73Who the hell are you?OH NONONO HAHAHAAHAHAHCan someone explain why Melvin haven\u2019t started to cover yet if they expire today?It\u2019s time to sell, not buy... the price doesn\u2019t reflect fundamentals...im all in on GME with my port and margin and i dont understand how. explain yourselfIm the defender of crazy gains. I love it when dumb money steals money form smart money. I\u2019ve been bullish on Gme and the time has come, now This shit will crash soon. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying lock in the gainzzzzpBecause this is nothing like VW short squeeze. Porsche own had like 90% ownership of shares. There still many players they can get shares from to keep squeezingYes it does, this company did 1.4 billion in revenue last year and its market cap was legit 1b before the run up. This is just a correction for valuation the real run up is the short squeezeYou stupid... boomer fucksuck my fundamental peenThe squeeze hasn\u2019t even started yet, they have to coverHey OP can you link to your image? I want to see details.So you don\u2019t think this is moving higher ?Bruh, I'm pretty sure they did 1.4b during the \\*holiday season\\* alone. \n\nTheir 2020 revenue was almost 6.5b according to marketwatch:\n\n[https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/stock\/gme\/financials](https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/investing\/stock\/gme\/financials)Bonds > gmehttps:\/\/fintel.io\/sob\/us\/gme\n\nClick OPT to arrange the calls and puts together. So you can see which institutions are doing whatI think it had the same squeeze it had on November and it\u2019s gonna dip down really quick. I\u2019m betting on another squeeze when news of earnings of Q1 come out. I really don\u2019t see it go that higher. I learnt my lesson of greediness back in November. I got in at $13 and jumped to $22 and I thought it would\u2019ve gone higher just like it\u2019s happening nowProves my point even more, these people just love to hate when we make gains. Thanks for helping me destroy this manHahaha nice oneSir, this is a casinoTold you to sell. Hope tou listened",

    "title": "$MARK - Walmart, Disney, other big names are partnering with this AI Based Thermal Imaging company",
    "description": "Remark Holdings Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0MARK) is flying in the market today, and it\u2019s nothing new. For several trading sessions, the stock has traded on either single, or double-digit gains.\nThe gains started when the company announced that it started shipping AI based thermal imaging technology to customers in the United States and Japan about two weeks ago. Recent evidence shows that one of these customers may be\u00a0Walmart Inc\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0WMT), but there\u2019s much more to this than Walmart. [article](https:\/\/alphastocknews.com\/remark-holdings-mark-stock-theres-more-to-it-than-walmart\/3352\/)\n\nDD done by \u201cInformed Observer\u201d\n\nMARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK\u2019s intrinsic value.\n\nMARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK\u2019s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.\n\nThe resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.\n\nThe Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company\u2019s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK\u2019s auditor has not resigned and the Company\u2019s past audits have been qualified with \u201cgoing concern\u201d risk language, so at this point the auditor\u2019s opinion letter can\u2019t get much worse\u2026.unless they refuse to provide an opinion\u2026which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.\n\nAs we get closer to MARK\u2019s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28\u2026.market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company\u2019s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company\u2019s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization\u2019s credibility.\n\nMARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company\u2019s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company\u2019s rare and effective official statement of April 30.\n\nIt is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK\u2019s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK\u2019s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK\u2019s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).\n\nThe value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG\u2019s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK\u2019s current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention.",

Trade at your own risk.350% IV, the lowest option strike available is $2.50 with a breakeven of $2.85, meaning you need a >90% increase in stock price to get in the money by july 19.\n\nThis is a stupid pump n dump.https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/active-trading\/083115\/4-signs-penny-stock-worth-millions.asp\n\nJust because it\u2019s a penny stock, doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have the potential to grow in valuation to fill a niche. Ford, Inovio, and SiriusXM were all once pennies. Pennies are volatile, and if you know little to no risk management and do little to no real DD, you\u2019ll always be going with the majority consensus which is brain dead and unsustainable if you\u2019re not looking to just get lucky in order to win. That mindset is going to lose you money trading at any level if you don\u2019t weigh in your own opinion, backed by solid research.\n\nThere is obviously a lot more work that needs to be done with MARK, and their PR team desperately needs a revamp, but there is a very large divide between those who believe this tech is going to find its footing and it\u2019s place in the upcoming months as a needed concept, and those who are trying to short it. I\u2019ve made huge profit on the recent pump & dump but there was no doubt in my mind to buy back in. Take what you will from your research, at the end of the day it\u2019s your money.

Its a form of security theatre. Business want them so they can make people feel safe but if government agencies aren't going to mandate them the demand of the thermal imaging technology is not going to substantially increase. Thermal Imaging does little to prevent COVID due to 80% of all people being asymptomatic of those who get infected.Still didn\u2019t age well hahayou sure about that lol?You\u2019re questioning if this will prevent the virus, a vaccine of some sort. That\u2019s not the purpose of thermal imaging or this company. A high percentage of Covid cases have fever like symptoms. I did not say all, but a high percentage. These thermal imaging devices can detect the body temperature within .3 percent. Facts matter, so I\u2019ll have to edit this comment with the links I read yesterday. So if big stores can preach safety to the public by being able to detect high body temperature before entering their stores, I\u2019m assuming that is a step towards preventing spread.

Especially options. But ignoring options for a little bit, I wanna focus on web development.\n\nThere are two kinds of autists; you guys, and the kind [who can actually make money.](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-08-21\/goldman-plans-hiring-spree-in-trading-only-coders-need-apply) A lot of the folks in that second camp have been spending the last 10+ years making web development easy and accessible so even retards like you and I can #LearnToCode. Doing this is important for a bunch of reasons - for example, if the internet of things is going to become a reality, it can't take years of development and a team of researchers for a company to build a connected toothbrush. \n\nIn other words, apps are going to become almost like commodities - in the sense that they will be cheap, fungible, and easily produced. And there won't be any shortage of people capable of doing that production - especially when you factor in educated workers from emerging markets. \n\nI think Alphabet has stayed ahead of the curve by positioning itself at the center of a lot of the otherwise open-source dev projects, whereas Amazon has it AWS. Companies like Snapchat and Uber, on the other hand, are billion-dollar commodities.",

If all it took to build the next facebook was coding it a lot more people would be trying.Op doesn\u2019t realize that the software piece is the easiest, getting the users is always the hardest.Great, so all you need to do is accurately predict when the next market crash will be.\n\nGo ahead.K boys let\u2019s clone a fake Uber repo and instantly make billions!Uber is lame afThe money is in the platform, not the app itself dipshitIt\u2019s all about the advertising dollars and having warm bodies viewing them. \n\nI saw a Trump 2020 ad on Snapchat last week, the 2020 election is going to be huge for social media platforms as political campaigns pour money to capture  new Gen Z voters.You zip it sparky, SPY or die, the rest are just icing on the cakeMy uber position is getting rekktAs a mid-level developer, I can tell you that the dropout rate for developers is massive. Even those that finish school or training programs are still in an uphill battle because nobody wants to hire a novice developer, that's more work than not hiring one at all. This causes many more new developers to get dropped off during the job search phase.\n\nDevelopers aren't in high demand due to a lack of people trying, it's due to a lack of talent because the early learning curve is steep and landing a job is rough.\n\nSoftware also has to be maintained and updated. It will never become worthless or \"cheap commodities\". The only exception are simple mobile games that get spit out like no other and never get touched again.Google will be fucked eventuallyI remember when Google tried to make Google+ the new Facebook. I'm pretty sure they relaunched that a few times too.I like you, you are all right with me SpermInvestor.(Serious tho)Exactly what I was thinking. The sw itself is largely a commodity (yes there are innovations in UI and UX) but the platform, reach and network effect is  why those mentioned companies are worth billions. Facebook and other consumer products would be worthless if there were no usersAnd MySpace was very popular ... right up until the point it wasn't. And how much did Tumblr recently sell for? I'm sure it still has a pretty big userbase. And if it doesn't, that still works in my favor. And how does the network effect apply to Uber?\n\nI'm not smart, I'm just not as much as a retard as you are - which is really my point here. That DURING A CRASH - i.e. when everything is going down - you wouldn't want to be the guy holding a company like Uber.I get that - but stocks are meant to be 10+ year investments. Putting your money in something easily replaceable\/upgradable for 10 years is risky.\n\nWhen people are looking for overly risky assets to dump (i.e. in a panic during a crash) I just think Uber and Snap will and should be high up on the listSent from UberPoolwhat else is there if i wanna go somewhere from my house, a fkin cab service that comes 40 min later??Honestly I think now's a good time to buy SNAP. Tripled in value recently, and there's still a lot of room to grow. If next years earnings are positive (which they should be) because the platform is growing. Yeah Snapchat has a growing userbase, mainly due to its popularity with people 11 > 21. Snapchat is worth roughly $15.9 a share. I think that could increase to $25 > $35 within two years, if the predicted recession doesn't happen in that time.\n\nAlso, even if a recession DOES HIT. Snapchat is a free service. Unless 20 million people suddenly decide they can't afford a cheap android smartphone, even if they can't afford a new IPhone, Snapchat won't be hit as hard as other companies, that provide luxury services. I'd probably buy even more SNAP stock if a recession hit. Double your profits when the world comes out the other side.Soxl\/FNGU or die*\n\nYolo like a manHowIt\u2019s a network effect because more clients attract more drivers, attract more clients,etc. The larger the user\/driver base the better the value proposal for everyone on the platform hence a network effect.\n\nPretty sure I\u2019m wasting my time explaining this to you though because your clearly a 15 years old trying to act like he knows shit.\n\nThe case agaisnt uber in a recession is clearly more the fact that it could be deemed a luxury good which would be the first expense people would cut in a recession. Not that the software is easily replicable.Why amazon?  AWS hosts some of the largest company\u2019s data and compute in the world.\n\nI just think you should be aware that in the olden days (90s) if your company could build it, it would be a success \u2014 mostly because people had good ideas but no one was sure if it was possible to actually build the hardware.  Now that most things are software they can almost always be built, but the question now is if anyone will want to buy or use it.  \n\nApps are already fairly easy to build, spend a couple grand to a few million and you can hire teams to do it fairly reliably.FDs don't last 10 years.     \n     \nYou're doing it wrong, bb.Yes, that\u2019s the drawback and largest risk of consumer companies, missing the trend ie AOL, Yahoo, MySpace. Continuous innovation to remain relevant and to meet consumer needs.$SBUX to 200 by 2021, now what?EU ~~shakedowns~~ fines?  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00afNetwork effect fails as it becomes a commodity. Currently, there's Uber and Lyft, and all their drivers drive for both. Soon, there will be a few dozen others, and we'll have TSLA and Waymo cars driving us around. As more drivers drive for more and more tech companies making riding apps, the less Uber and Lyft make. When anyone gets self driving to work, there will be as many cars as that company and it's VC backing can afford. Then we'll have the scooter situation... My metro started with one scooter and one bike company; now there are seven companies renting scooters and five renting bikes. Our streets are littered with them. And I really those bitches off every curb I see. It's awesome.Ah the good old days.85% of their revenues comes from ads. Banner ads are already getting destroyed by Adblock browsers like brave. \n\nI see the web moving towards privacy by default in the future. Which leaves their ad revenue model in troubleI think its a bit more nuanced. Uber and Lyft are the main two, Juno is kinda in NYC but not really. If you wanted to start another driver network it would fail b\/c 1 the space is full and 2 the model isn't profitable with human drivers. In the begging you can cobble together an app and enter the market but I don't think this is the main stopping point for ppl with millions to invest in a company.Ad blockers don't exist on mobile, and the vast majority of web browsing is moving to mobile. Also, in a more privacy-focused future, their ads would be less targeted, not less prevalent.     \n     \nLook at stats on ad blockers to see how dumb you are, ya pathetic downvoter. Lol.That's fair. But, others will follow Juno in select areas, and there are (supposedly) driverless options coming.   \n     \nE: it'd also make sense for F and GM and other auto manufacturers to get in on this game. I could see discounted cars for their exclusive drivers or something. Idk.Ad blockers don\u2019t exist on mobile?Ad blockers do exist on mobile browsers... I use one nowyou are right googles ads would be less targeted. Which means less effective as an advertisement tool. If users flock to a privacy by default browsers like brave they can grow out their own ad system they are developing now. Googles ads have become spywareish with trackers\/malware whereas braves aim to show you targeted ads but it lets the browser decide on the targeting without spilling your data over the network to publishers, advertisers or Brave itself. It gauges your interest chiefly by the content of websites you visit while browsing. \n\nThere\u2019s also a machine learning aspect to the browser that measures your engagement with the ad and pays you for your attention. \n\nI\u2019ve been using the browser on mobile and desktop solely for its speed and adblocking capabilities. I haven\u2019t seen an ad on YouTube or even pornhub for a whileI don't think others will hop in since drivers are not sustainable and creating a network now would be a big marketing push. Could maybe make something work but I doubt the juice is worth the squeeze. Would have to find some niche to stand out. Uber\/Lyft are reliable, Juno supposedly shares profit betterSorry, ad blockers suck on mobile, and are used much less frequently, especially on iPhone.On some browsers, but they're not as good and used much less frequently, especially on iPhone.Lol. Fuck Brave and their shitty shakedown-style business tactics. Also, fuck them fom breaking websites by randomly selecting what JavaScript gets blocked -- like Pornhub's pagination buttons or YouTube's follow-up video recommendations. I want that shit to work, and Brave fails in that respect.        \n     \nLastly, you clearly have no idea how Google Ads works. They don't share any of their user's personal info with their advertisers. You're either shilling for Brave, lying for kicks, or just plain ignorant.That's just it, tho. Drivers sustain better with more apps. That's why they all drive for both Uber and Lyft. If there's a third or fourth option, the drivers also see the benefits of their marketing efforts. But, yeah, too many variables and way too much lucky timing required for me. I'm going to stick to randomly guessing if presidential tweets are going to blast my ass with uppies or blast my ass with downies. Cheers.Lol I\u2019m not shilling anything. I don\u2019t own any BAT. Just enjoy their product and saying eventually googles market dominance won\u2019t be as prevalentSo..... brave just caught google using hidden web pages to give user data to advertisers.... so fuck google and their intrusive practices. I\u2019ll take the occasional broken web sitehttps:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.techspot.com\/amp\/news\/81746-brave-browser-team-google-using-hidden-pages-circumvent.htmlI believe that...which makes you lying for kicks or just ignorant \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af I'm usually the latter. Cheers.I call bullshit. Provide a legit source if you're going to make that level of outlandish crap.     \n      \nE: also, if you're talking about [this](https:\/\/www.techspot.com\/news\/81746-brave-browser-team-google-using-hidden-pages-circumvent.html), you're an idiot with shit reading comprehension and critical thinking skills. Lol.You must've missed my edit. That's the exact same link that I said you'd be an idiot to cite. Lmfao.    \n     \nThat accusation was made a year ago, and the \"hidden\" pages they \"found\" don't support their argument.     \n      \nBrave often levels such accusations in an attempt to gain traction and obfuscate what's actually happening. They lie to confuse idiots into using their shitty browser so that they can then push their own advertising. It's as scummy as business models get, and sooner or later someone's going to sue them into oblivion for it.     \n    \nIf you want to not lose money, I suggest you carefully consider [Google's response](https:\/\/www.tomshardware.com\/news\/brave-google-push-pages-violate-gdpr-privacy,40330.html) and ask yourself why the stock jumped for the last couple days despite Brave's releasing this \"evidence\" (lol) three days ago.

My question is: why only 5%? You should lose at least 60% of your portfolio next week.SO HOW DID THIS GOWhy not both?  Buy a put and call. It can go either way. \n\nTesla car owners aren\u2019t the people getting laid off (at least, not entirely).  These people can never afford an $80k car anyways. Even a $40k car is entry luxury level. \n\nThe owners are the programmers working from home. Or the senior management that can work from home, and will jump to another company, if they lose their job. Or the small business owners that can mint cash, once this crisis is over.\n\nAlso, because of Tesla\u2019s online ordering, then you don\u2019t need to visit a dealership. \n\nAnd since it\u2019s electric, it has less need for maintenance, so you don\u2019t need to visit a mechanic. Perfect for the stay-at-home pandemic. \n\nTheir target market has always been the upper class, and white collar workers.Automod wya?FFFTsla is fierce the strongest of the bullsProof or I own $100,000,000 of 800CRemindMe! 6 daysBetter off shorting 2 sharesSometimes you have to learn the hard wayDid you dump on Wednesday or hold?What\u2019s the payout on that 1300?

    "description": "Greetings fellow autists. Y'all remember Marie Kondo? Japanese woman that gets off to cleaning people's shit up for them? Only keep things that spark joy? Fuck yeah. Well, with all you retards losing money by being balls long PLTR, I figured it was time to help you Marie Kondo your own portfolio. Let's tidy that shit up and spark some fucking Joyy.\n\nYes I spelled Joyy with two y's. And no big brain, that wasn't a typo. **Joyy ($YY) is your next one-way ticket to the goddamn moon.** Can you do basic math? Great. Neither can I. Do you get slightly aroused at the mere sight of a woman with a pulse? Of course you do. I myself just went six to midnight typing that out. Do you like losing money in the stonk market? Clearly. But I'm here to try to change that.\n\nCongrats on making it this far. Let's get started!\n\n$YY is the largest live-streaming platform you've never heard of. **It's like if TikTok merged with OnlyFans and was a publicly traded stonk**. I'll wait while you buy a few shares on that premise alone.\n\nBut it gets better. Much better. Joyy operates two live-streaming services, one is called YY Live and its getting sold to Baidu for $3.6bn. **The other is called Bigo Live and it's one of the top 10 apps in the world with revenues growing more than 130% y\/y.** Many of the videos on Bigo are of hot Asian women live-streaming themselves dancing. Nice.\n\nThat's still not even the best part though. Galaxy brain question: would you rather pay full price for something or get something at a discount? What if you could get it for close to free? Well, at YY's current price, you're nearly getting Bigo Live for free. Please consult a doctor if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours.\n\nHow can that be? This part requires some remedial math skills that you and I both don't have, but alas, we must soldier on.\n\nYY currently has $2.8bn in net cash on their balance sheet. Woah! I didn't know this was a fucking advanced accounting class. Well it is. Stay with me. We also know YY is going to get $3.6bn in cash from Baidu for the sale of YY Live. Lastly, YY is an investor in a company called HUYA that is valued at $750mm.\n\nSo... $2.8bn plus $3.6bn plus $750mm is? No, not $420.69 you retard. Try again. It's $7.1bn. Feel free to sit down and drink a sip of water if your head is spinning from all these numbers.\n\nCompare this $7.1bn to YY's current market cap of $7.8bn. $7.8bn minus $7.1bn for everything that isn't Bigo Live is $600mm. There you have it. That's the implied value the market is giving to Bigo Live.\n\nHoly shit right? To quote the great David Byrne from Talking Heads: [you may ask yourself](https:\/\/youtu.be\/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=69)...\n\n* Didn't Baidu just pay $3.6bn for YY Live?\n* And isn't Bigo Live growing 130%+ while YY Live is barely growing?\n* And aren't Bigo Live and YY Live about the same size at $1.8bn in revenues?\n* And finally \u2013 you may ask yourself \u2013 if Baidu is willing to pay $3.6bn for YY Live, shouldn't Bigo Live be valued way the fuck more than that?\n\n**The answer to all of these questions is fuck yes.** Bigo Live should be valued way higher than $600mm but you retards are too busy jacking off and losing money on PLTR to figure it out.\n\n**The other great part about YY is we get to fuck some bears on our way to the moon**. I cannot expressly condone nor condemn the actual fucking of bears, but I can condone the fucking of some short sellers. Muddy Waters just released a short report on Joyy and short sellers piled in like the dumbass lemmings they are. How did YY respond to the short report you may ask? **By giving MW the double middle finger and increasing their dividend by $200mm.** Do frauds usually do that? Hell no they don't.\n\nThat's how you fucking spark Joyy in your portfolio!",

December 02, 2020 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against JOYY Inc. (\"JOYY\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: YY) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired JOYY securities between April 28, 2016 and November 18, 2020, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm\u2019s site: www.bgandg.com\/yy.\n\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and\/or misleading statements and\/or failed to disclose that: (1) JOYY dramatically overstated its revenues from live streaming sources;You had me at GreI heard YY is XXX approved!IunnoNot enough hype! Sticking with TSLA and GRWG.KonMari my Account daddyPuts it is!! Once it's time to be audited YY wont be around in the USWhen Muddy Waters shorts a China stock, I stay far far away. His DD on China frauds is phenomenal. It'll be interesting to see what happens to YY tomorrow. There's a theory that a delisting risk would hammer those stock the most that couldn't possibly stand up to US audit scrutiny.Even if I could read its too long to read, i ll pass.that feeling when you're in a deep rabbit hole and end up watching some weird shit on youtube.Ban this shillYY 40p leap here.

OP tried to get people to short TeleDoc 3 years ago when it was at $21 a share.Seen another post about YY a few minutes ago. Probably some pump and dump attemptYY will not have any direct exposure to China after the YY Live deal closes. They're headquartered in Singapore. Plus, why just take a picture of your dong after jerk off onto a hundo when you could livestream the whole thing?YY is headquartered in Singapore and their only direct exposure to China is through YY Live. After the sale to Baidu closes, they'll no longer have any direct exposure to Chinese regulations or risk from the potential delisting of Chinese stocks.Those lawsuits don't mean anything. I remember when hundreds of these lawsuits were coming after NIO back when their stock was in freefall mode. Just a bunch of salty boomers\/karens that can't accept responsibility for choosing a shitty stock. Its quite pathetic actually since you never see any of us filing a lawsuit for our terrible decision making.Thought so. Thanks for confirming.We will have to see. I personally am bearish and believe the allegations. If the sale to Baidu completes AND the company is cleared of fraud, that would be the time to buy in.\n\nRight now YY is like Nikola with extreme up\/down potential depending on how the fraud case plays out, and whether their partnership continues.Like Nikola is perhaps the most retarded comparison I've heard in at least an hour...good job.Exactly. Fraud confirmed, stock kaput. In China everything is basically Luckin Coffee anyways.",
